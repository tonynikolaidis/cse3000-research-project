Before producing your CSV output, you must internally reason through each stance decision for each speaker. Your default label is 0 (neutral).

For any non-neutral label (1 or -1), follow this procedure:
1. Find Evidence First: Search the transcript for a specific part where the speakerâ€™s words suggest a clear stance.
2. Decide: If you believe the content supports a stance, tentatively assign 1 or -1.
3. Verify Justification: Check whether your explanation truly and explicitly supports the assigned label.
4. Revert if Unjustified: If the justification does not clearly warrant the stance, revert the label to 0.

Only assign a stance when you have explicit and supportable reasoning grounded in the transcript.
