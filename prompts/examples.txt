Example 1:

- Excerpt from a transcript:
"    Chairman Comer. Unfortunately, the FDA under President Biden is suffering 
from dysfunction and is failing to do bare minimum to carry out 
its core mission, which is to make certain our Nation's food 
and drug products are safe and effective. Further, the FDA 
appears consistently unprepared for certain crises. That is why 
our Committee has conducted several investigations into areas 
of concern at the FDA. These investigations have identified a 
pattern of issues within the FDA."

- Stance of Chairman Comer towards "FDA under Biden":

Example 2:

- Excerpt from a transcript:
"    Mr. Raskin. Under Biden, FDA has improved access to contraception and protections 
for medication abortion access. In 2021, FDA advanced the 
accessibility of medication abortion by removing the in-person 
dispensing requirement for mifepristone and allowing it to be 
distributed by mail through retail pharmacies. In July 2023, 
FDA approved the first over-the-counter birth control pill, 
Opill. As a result, consumers' access to contraception has 
improved at a critical time when many states are enacting 
increasingly draconian and oppressive abortion restrictions."

Example 3:
- Excerpt from a transcript:
"    Mr. Gosar. I thank the Chairman. Now obviously, the FDA 
made a mistake in granting the Emergency Use Authorization and 
license of COVID-19 vaccines. It has been confirmed that the 
vaccines do not stop transmission. Moreover, 1,635,048 injuries 
due to COVID-19 vaccines have been reported to the Health and 
Human Services through the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting 
System, including 37,382 deaths."

Example 4:

- Excerpt from a transcript:
"    Dr. Califf. FDA's continued oversight will be critical until supply 
chains are more resilient, particularly for infant formula. We 
will continue to promote competition in manufacturing quality 
and implement modernized systems to respond to shortages 
faster. It is why we have requested additional authorities that 
would provide more visibility into the supply chain."

Example 5:
- Excerpt from a transcript:
"    Mr. Grothman. Throughout the COVID 
epidemic, I spoke multiple times on the floor with regard to 
the value of vitamin D. Now, the adequate level of vitamin D 
varies depending upon how you talk to, you know, 20 nanograms, 
30 nanograms, 50 nanograms, but whatever the study you look at, 
the number of lives saved if everybody had adequate levels of 
vitamin D is tremendous, OK? It is a relatively cheap vitamin, 
but for whatever reason it was not pushed by the medical 
establishment and resulted, in my opinion, in the deaths of 
hundreds of thousands of people."
