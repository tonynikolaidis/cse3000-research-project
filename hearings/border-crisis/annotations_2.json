Welcome, everyone.\n\nWithout objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time.\n\nI recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration's open border policies have led to the worst border crisis in American history, by a mile. Millions of illegal immigrants have entered the United States under the Biden-Harris Administration in a short period of time, affecting every community across the country. This was not the result of so-called root causes in Central America, as Kamala Harris has said. Individuals from all over the world have entered the U.S. under the Biden-Harris Administration because they can. Obviously, we have the greatest country in the history of the world right now, I guess you could say, and it is not surprising that the whole world wouldn't try to come here.\n\nIn the first 7 months of Fiscal Year 2024, nearly half of the inadmissible aliens encountered at the Southwest border were from countries other than Mexico, the Northern Triangle countries, and Nicaragua. I should point out that by the end of September, we already had the all-time record number of people coming across the Southern border, so whatever we get across when the numbers are released in September will only add to the record.\n\nThis crisis did not result from lack of authority. The Biden Administration has all the tools it needs to end this crisis. For example, it can reinstate the Trump Administration's policies that worked, such as Remain in Mexico and detention rather than mass release of illegal immigrants. They could continue to build the wall, which a Border Patrol agent told us is a force multiplier in the mission to secure the border. The Senate border bill, Vice President Harris vows to sign into law, certainly would not have helped. It would have codified the catch-and-release policies of the Biden- Harris Administration that caused this crisis in the first place and allowed up to 1.8 million illegal immigrants to enter per year before temporarily closing parts of the border.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration's refusal to secure the border and, instead, allow millions of poorly vetted aliens from all over the world to be released is not without cost, both human and economic. Illegal immigrants released into the U.S. by the Biden-Harris Administration have gone on to commit violent crimes against Americans. These murders, rapes, burglaries, and violent assaults should never have happened. Under the Biden Administration, foreign gangs are running rampant in our communities. It is not just MS-13. According to DHS, a new violent gang has spread from the communist regime in Venezuela--Tren de Aragua--across the United States. This gang has been described as MS-13 on steroids. When a mob of illegal immigrants stormed the border in El Paso in March, over 100 were suspected members of the gang. The Biden-Harris Administration has released 617,000 illegal immigrants with known criminal backgrounds. That does not even include the almost 2 million illegal aliens who evaded apprehension entirely. We do not know where these got-aways are, what their criminal histories are, or what their intentions are.\n\nIn addition to the real tragic costs of this border crisis, there have been significant fiscal costs. Estimates show that despite paying some taxes, illegal aliens are a net drain on America. Experts estimate each illegal immigrant costs the taxpayer roughly $68,000. They use more public services than they contribute in taxes. The Biden-Harris Administration's weak job growth numbers are further diluted by the fact that the majority of those jobs have gone to foreign-born workers. In the past 12 months, U.S.-born workers lost more than 1.3 million jobs where foreign born workers gained over 1.2 million. I will tell you, during the first 20 years of my political career in Wisconsin, I would again and again have the lobbyist for the carpenters' union in my office, begging us to do something about all the illegal immigrants here using Social Security cards, stealing the jobs, the good union jobs, my friend would say, stealing the good union jobs from carpenters.\n\nThere is already a housing crisis in this country. Estimates state that the U.S. is 4 million to 7 million housing units short of where they should be. So, not only do illegal immigrants compete for Americans for jobs, but also compete with Americans for housing. The Biden-Harris Administration's mass release of illegal immigrant in our country is not in the interest of the American people. We cannot afford 4 more years of a chaotic border.\n\nI should point out that in America, we are not anti- immigrant. Every year, about 850,000 new citizens are sworn into our country. If you look at it, sometimes there is a spike, but if you look at it in 3-year increments, there has never been a time in our history in which we have had more people sworn in as new immigrants. And what do we get for being so gracious and allowing so many people in this country? We get kicked in the face by having all other people coming here anyway.\n\nWell, there is my opening statement, and I will call upon my Ranking Member, Mr. Garcia."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.022697Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:31:10.041708Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2,"annotations":[{"id":2,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"X2dPxVHQbc","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"xXxJindSgJ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:35:08.690589Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:35:08.690621Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-16T12:31:40.935464Z","lead_time":238.161,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"61da4783-3d03-4122-bad1-83d21c948a01","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":2,"text":"Mr. Garcia Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you to our witnesses also for being here.\n\nYou know, I think that, obviously, all folks in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, want a safe and secure border. I think what we have are different approaches to how we treat immigrants, a humane system, and ensuring we do not go back to a process that was inhumane to people that are oftentimes struggling and just seeking a better life. We do not want to go back to family separation, to Muslim bans, to undermining our asylum system. And we know we can achieve a comprehensive goal that both has secure border, but also a plan for immigrants that are here in this country and are working hard to contribute to our economy and to our country.\n\nNow, legal pathways to ensure an orderly and humane process are important. I strongly support legal immigration because we are a Nation of immigrants. Immigrants are some of the most patriotic people I know in our country. They make our communities stronger. They work hard. They build our country. I am an immigrant. I came to this country as a young child. I love America. I think it is the best country on Earth. When I raised my right hand, it was the proudest day of my life, and I am giving back to this country--I try to--every single day, and the same is true for everyone in my family who are also immigrants. But I also want to be clear why I think we are here today. It is because some folks in Congress, and certainly Donald Trump, think that bashing immigrants will win this election.\n\nNow, 2 weeks ago, during a bizarre debate performance, we saw, of course, the former President repeat manufactured conspiracies about immigrants, and in this case, Haitian immigrants in Ohio. As we now remember his horrible quote, ``They are eating the dogs, the people that came in, they are eating the cats, they are eating the pets of the people that live here, and this is what is happening in our country, and it is a shame.'' Now, we know that has been completely debunked. The Republican Governor of Ohio, the Republican mayor of the city, the city manager, and now even the woman that first made the claim, who is also a Trump supporter in Springfield, all have said that this was not true. Yet, the lie continues to be repeated. J.D. Vance and other Members of Congress have continued to amplify this xenophobic lie, and it is a shame. And we know it gets worse. We know that Haitian immigrants in Springfield also are overwhelmingly there on legal work permits. They are actually there legally and were invited by the state and the city to work, but that has not stopped J.D. Vance and Donald Trump from threatening to revoke their status and to allow a mass deportation agenda.\n\nNow, Donald Trump's rhetoric has been dividing us and stoking anti-immigrant hate, I believe, since he first came down that escalator in 2015 to announce that he thought Mexicans were rapists and murderers, and he says families like mine and other immigrants are poisoning the blood of this country. Those are the facts. Now, I am glad to say that the American people, however, do not buy that. A CBS poll found that only one-third of voters approve of Trump's claims about immigrants, and almost 65 percent believe his recent claims are false, which we know that they are. But here are some more facts. Donald Trump is not interested in border security. He killed the bipartisan border deal that was in front of the Congress. And the Biden-Harris Administration has taken robust action to secure the border, and we are now seeing the results of that. And there is no immigrant crime wave, and I respectfully disagree with the Chairman. In fact, our Nation is safer today and has less crime today than it did when Donald Trump left office. Those are the facts being reported by police departments across the country.\n\nAnd finally, I will reiterate I believe immigrants are inherently part of this country. They are the backbone of our country. They make our country safer, stronger and better. With that, I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.022842Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:35:08.739011Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3,"annotations":[{"id":3,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"jkmiwZyyI4","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"UWNqwIQvzd","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:35:14.269694Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:35:14.269730Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":5.215,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"588e6ba7-47f8-4cf6-8ade-e419e9981c59","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":3,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":3,"text":"Mr. Grothman I have got to respond a little bit."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.022926Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:35:14.318090Z","inner_id":3,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":4,"annotations":[{"id":4,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"eJg2eHkZVQ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"W2wwzXdSk1","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:35:17.697417Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:35:17.697449Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.056,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"70f78684-7724-4abf-959e-0505d02c55d2","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":4,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":4,"text":"Mr. Sessions.

As you say, my name is Steven Camarota. I am Director of Research at the Center for Immigration Studies. My testimony today will focus on the impact of illegal immigration on housing, public coffers, and American workers, but let me first turn to the unprecedented scale of recent illegal immigration.\n\nHouse Judiciary just last month reported that 5.6 million illegal immigrants have been released into the country since January 2021. These are all inadmissible aliens and under various categories. There have also been 1.7 million got-aways at the border in Fiscal Year 2021 to 2023. We do not know what it is for 2024. These are all people observed entering illegally but not stopped. Visa overstays also appear to be at record levels, but we do not have all the data.\n\nNow, all of these numbers represent new additions to the illegal immigrant population, but of course mortality, out migration, and legalizations each year offset these numbers to some extent. Still, I conservatively estimate that the illegal immigrant population has grown by 4 million since January 2021, based on data collected by the Census Bureau. This is almost certainly the fastest it has ever grown. All this illegal immigration has consequences.\n\nTurning first to housing, prior research shows that by increasing demand, immigration drives up cost for housing. My own analysis suggests that a 5-percentage-point increase in the share of a community comprised of recent immigrants will cause a 12-percent increase in what the average U.S.-born household pays in rent. Bottom line, this influx has impacted housing.\n\nTurning to the fiscal impact, using estimates developed by the National Academy of Sciences, we calculate that the lifetime fiscal drain, considering all the taxes an illegal immigrant may pay and all the services and costs they would create, is about $68,000 per illegal immigrant, or, if you like, $68 billion for each 1 million illegal immigrants. This drain is primarily due to the modest education levels of most illegal immigrants. An estimated 79 percent have no education beyond high school, which is about double the share of the U.S. born. This results in low average incomes, tax payments, and along with a significant amount of use of public services, including welfare programs, which they often receive on behalf of the U.S.-born children. But this drain is not because illegal immigrants are lazy. It is not because they all came for welfare. Most illegal immigrants, in fact, work. Rather it simply reflects what happens when you add large numbers of less educated people who have modest incomes to a modern economy that spends a lot on social services.\n\nFinally, let me touch on the labor market. First, the idea that illegal immigrants only do jobs that Americans do not want is false. Of the 474 occupations, as defined by the Department of Commerce, only 6 are majority immigrant, and we can find none that look to be majority illegal immigrant. There is good evidence that immigration, by increasing the supply of workers, reduces wages and employment for some American workers, though distinguishing the impact between legal and illegal is always challenging.\n\nBut perhaps the most important thing to think about is this immigration is occurring in the context of the well-documented long-term increase in the share of working-class U.S.-born men not in the labor force, and they do not show up as unemployed because they are not actively looking for work. Let me give you one example. About 1 out of 9 U.S.-born men, 16 to 64, with no education beyond high school, was not in the labor force in 1960. By 2000, it was 1 out of 4. Today, of these working age men, it is about 1 out of 3. Job competition with illegal immigrants is only part of the reason for this. However, tolerating large-scale illegal immigration has allowed employers and, frankly, policymakers to ignore this huge social problem. After all, why care about all the working-age Americans on the economic sidelines if we can just hire eager immigrants? But the huge increase in American men not in the labor force is linked to significant social problems, from drug overdose deaths to crime to suicide and alcoholism. Reducing illegal immigration would help force the country to deal with this huge problem in our labor market.\n\nThank you."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.024168Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:46:13.257667Z","inner_id":17,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":18,"annotations":[{"id":18,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"vKXUtsn0P9","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"8rrr0Lo10i","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:46:16.128562Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:46:16.128592Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.525,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"c33adfab-2b5e-4f96-8c2e-e90f17c9a3d0","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":18,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":18,"text":"Mr. Grothman.

My name is Chris Clem. I am a retired Chief Patrol Agent of the U.S. Border Patrol. I began my career in 1995 in Lordsburg, New Mexico, as a GS-5 Border Patrol agent trainee, and retired 21 months ago as a Senior Executive Service Chief Patrol Agent in Yuma, Arizona. Therefore, my responses and testimony today will be based on the best recollection of my experiences and observations over the last 28 years.\n\nI spent most of my career along the Southwest border where I was a canine handler, collateral duty intelligence officer, firearms instructor, and I spent a few years in Washington, DC. and New Orleans, Louisiana. I was a career government employee who served under five Presidential administrations, starting under Clinton and ending under Biden. I was not a political appointee. I promoted through the ranks through competitive process and commanded four Border Patrol stations across New Mexico, Texas, and Arizona. I served as the Deputy Chief Patrol Agent, New Orleans Sector, El Paso Sector, and the Acting Chief in Big Bend Sector, before I was promoted to the Chief Patrol Agent in Yuma, Arizona 2 years before I retired.\n\nI spent time as an agent in remote locations as well as urban environments. And I can tell you, if you have been to one station, you have been to just one station. If you have been to one sector, you have been to one sector. Each location is different, its own set of unique circumstances, from terrain to infrastructure to communities and to threats. However, the one thing that is consistent across the spectrum, without border security, our agents, our community, the migrants, and our country, are vulnerable. While immigration and border security are closely related, they are not mutually exclusive. However, without proper border security in the form of physical security, Border Patrol agents, strong policies and consequences, the integrity of the immigration system is compromised, and the founding principles surrounding the rule of law can suffer.\n\nMy statement testimony today will be focused on border security, to which I would be considered a subject matter expert. Immigration, as mentioned, is related, but can only be effective and efficient when the border is secured. This Committee and Congress have access to all the available data, and the staunch difference between the previous Administration the current is gut wrenching and jaw dropping. I understand not every threat to our great Nation will come directly across the border, but why would we be willing to even risk it?\n\nWe know there are countless gaps and vulnerabilities created along the border, specifically our Southern border. We are on the heels of recent testimoneys from the FBI Director that indicate threats are real. With hot spots around the world and what has happened under the current Administration, there are more than enough reasons to secure our border and put back in place the plan as intended to include infrastructure, technology, and policies. We need the wall installed and completed where it makes sense, we need the technology installed as intended, and we need to increase the number of Border Patrol agents and border security personnel as requested by senior field leaders. It is also my opinion that a border security bill should be submitted as a standalone bill. This bill should be based on the needs of Border Patrol field chiefs, as required by their agents, to complete our security mission.\n\nIn addition to the physical needs to secure our border, our agents' fleet is in dire straits, with upwards of 50 percent needing replacement. Our agents, when fully operational, spend more than half their time in their vehicles doing their job. We need to focus on funding on fleet and facilities for our agents, intelligence, and administrative staff, not just migrant processing. We must give our agents back the purpose of mission, use funding appropriately to support them over the inadmissible aliens.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement investigations and detention agencies should also be included in this package. It is when this bill is signed into law, and then, and only then, should we have a separate immigration system overhaul. This will allow border security solutions to stand on the principle of American security and minimize the tradeoffs over outside interests for immigration reforms. A standalone border bill that addresses the obligation of the government to protect its borders and people will not only make us safer, but will also give a much-needed boost to the Border Patrol agents who have had to be put in the middle of this nightmare with little support and advocacy from this White House.\n\nFor years, while working for the U.S. Government as a U.S. Border Patrol agent, and even more so today, I have said border security is national security and public safety. There have been far too many impacts to Americans and American cities by this border crisis to mention. I accept that immigration is emotional to so many, but we cannot conflate immigration with border security. If we took a strong focus on securing our border with real, proven solutions, we can make our country stronger and safer while reducing the risk as well as the impacts throughout the country, and then we can address the immigration needs of our country. We should always strive to remain that beacon of hope for those that are being persecuted and tortured, but beyond that, we should not put our country at risk. We can secure our border with commonsense and compassion that keeps our country safe.\n\nI want to thank you for the opportunity to speak today, and while much of my testimony is similar to one earlier this year, the fact is that fundamental needs of border security have still not been met. My full statement has been submitted for the record, and I look forward to your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.024393Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:48:58.955382Z","inner_id":19,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":20,"annotations":[{"id":20,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"osg__S1y1i","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"iznfFWm4Ot","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:52:54.733777Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:52:54.733805Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-16T12:49:24.067497Z","lead_time":235.264,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"3bc17037-e093-499c-aca1-5dfe570d04bf","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":20,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":20,"text":"Mr. Isacson Chairman Grothman, Ranking Member Garcia, thank you for inviting me to speak with you today. I last testified in the House 10 months ago. Since then, the number of migrants entering Border Patrol custody has dropped by more than three-quarters. Fewer people came to the border in July and August than in 9 different months of the Trump Administration. As my written testimony explains, that is because two crackdowns have brought the numbers down for now, one in Mexico and one in the U.S. asylum system. Their effect will not be permanent, but they do give us all a moment of calm. Our hair is not on fire right now, we can have a chance to discuss better solutions, and I am going to advise against even more crackdowns.\n\nOver and over again, regardless of who is President, when there is a crackdown on migrants, the curve always shows a dive, a bottoming out, and then a recovery. You can see a chart in my written testimony of the past 10 years: crackdown, recovery, crackdown, recovery. Even during the Trump presidency, migration rose twice. You had sort of the caravan and family asylum seeker period in 2018 and 2019, punctuated by family separations in 2018, but that did not make that much of a difference.\n\nIn mid-2019, Remain in Mexico did bring the numbers down, but then that had leveled off by the fall, and into spring 2020 was leveled off, and then COVID came and closed the world's borders. The second increase was the last 8 or 9 months of the Trump Administration. Title 42 was in effect, but from April 2020 onward, every month was greater than the last. Border Patrol apprehensions tripled from May to October, an absolute hockey stick change.\n\nJoe Biden inherited more than 70,000 encounters per month, nearly a quarter more than there are right now. President Biden kept Title 42 in place. His Administration expelled 2.5 million people. By the way, Remain in Mexico, under Trump, 71,000 people, but people kept coming. One of the toughest crackdowns ever did not stop them. Why? The answer has to do with the futility of fighting against geography and fighting against the law of supply and demand. My written testimony discusses that more.\n\nSo, now while crackdowns do not work, I will be clear. I also do not want to see huge numbers of people coming to the U.S. Mexico border. Those people you see coming in to turn themselves into Border Patrol, they are doing that because applying for asylum requires you to be physically on U.S. soil. In order to get to U.S. soil, most of these people, they go through absolute hell. I am amazed by the desperation of moms I have seen pushing strollers at the entrance to the Darien Gap, the determination of people who just keep going, even after being kidnapped and tortured by Mexican gangs and corrupt police, but it is heartbreaking. This route encourages and enriches bloodthirsty organized crime groups.\n\nSo, how do we break out of feudal crackdowns and also, at the same time, break out of forcing people to come to the border? First, with reforms to how people can come here. We need to be able to make clear that a process exists, that there is a line that people can get into, even though it may take a while. Right now, there is virtually no process, no line. Just because someone might not qualify for asylum does not mean that they and their family do not have a lot to offer for our communities and our economy.\n\nOur immigration laws, though, have not fundamentally changed in 34 years. I am talking 1990. I was 20 that year. I am kind of a techie kind of guy. I did not even have an email address in 1990. This is a very long time ago. Residency, work permits, refugee admissions have changed very little since the first Bush Administration. We need to modernize, and if we did, we would have a lot less people making this dangerous journey to access our asylum system at the border. Second, though, as troubled as it is, we still have to defend that asylum system. We should not put asylum out of reach like H.R. 2 would do. That is for four good reasons. First, asylum exists for an important historical reason. It is a legacy of World War II. When countries turned away many people fleeing the Nazis and Stalin and those people died, much of the world said never again, including the United States. Reason two, a lot of people really do qualify for asylum. In our immigration courts this year, 48 percent of asylum cases ended with grants of asylum or other protection. That is hundreds of thousands of lives saved over the years.\n\nReason three, we have kept our asylum system so anemically underfunded that it is overwhelmed. Wait times for a decision are routinely several years, and then that overwhelm, that wait time, it becomes its own draw, but this is fixable. It is an administrative problem. How? Get processing off of Border Patrol agents' to-do lists so that they can get back on the line. About a thousand processing coordinators have been hired, people who do not need a full course of academy training to do paperwork. That is a start. Get case management in place so that you can keep people in the system. And most of all, hire judges and asylum officers so the caseloads go down, backlogs go down, people get fair decisions in their cases--but the cases happen so quickly, even with fairness, that people with weaker cases do not try.\n\nReason four, as I said, our immigration laws are so outdated that asylum is the only door open for many people. We have to fix that. That is the reality.\n\nSo now, we have got this lull in migration at the border, let us talk about new ways forward. I think that we can do that perhaps once the election cycle ends. Thank you, and I look forward to discussing this further."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.024491Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:52:54.781776Z","inner_id":20,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":21,"annotations":[{"id":21,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"IPOMNfZctZ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"O9sXK1K1xu","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:53:36.508317Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T12:53:36.508348Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":41.294,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"52f61279-6918-412c-a3b8-e06b31eb25cc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":21,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":21,"text":"Mr. Grothman Thank you.

Let us get to this thing, the Muslim ban that was mentioned. What countries were involved in the Muslim ban? Anybody know? I know. Anybody want to take guess? I will tell you who they were: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, and North Korea. Is North Korea a Muslim country? No, it is not. What do those countries, 6 of those 7 countries, have in common? Actually, they have in common that four of them were on President Obama's DHS Terrorist Watch List. The other four were considered terrorism safe havens. Only 12 percent of Muslims around the world were impacted. And besides that\n\n--Mr. Clem knows this, Mr. Camerato knows this, I would hope Mr. Isacson knows this--there were exceptions for every one of those countries to come in, so there was not an absolute ban. Another lie told by the left.\n\nHow about separation? This notion of separation, more than 325,000 unaccompanied children have been misplaced by this Administration, admitted to. New York Times did a study. We had the Director in, and she admitted that is a separation. You know what these guys got criticized for, is about 4,000 people, kids, that were separated, and they found them all, but a few. These guys cannot find 325,000, but you are not going to hear my colleagues say anything about it.\n\nU.S. crime rate is not down, contrary to what you say, and why do we know that? Does LAPD report? No. Does New York report? No. Does Miami-Dade report? No. Do more than 6,000 police agencies obviate any reporting? That is the correct thing. They do not report. So, when you say New York is down, guess what, friend? They do not report to the FBI anymore. They do not report anymore. They stopped reporting several years ago. Why is it? They have told me it is too hard to report, and so that is what you are relying on.\n\nYou know what the CBP said about Tren de Aragua? Tren de Aragua is now moving into the Northeast, but crime is down for you. That is good for you, my friend. CBP numbers, you said they are way down. I am looking at CBP numbers right here, looking at them right here, and you know what I see? Let us see here, August 2023, 304,000. They are down, you are right, almost 50 percent. They are down to 160,000, but you know what is interesting about that? Jeh Johnson, Obama's DHS Secretary said, `look, if you have more than 1,000 a day, you have got a crisis.' Mr. Clem, is that a crisis? You have been there. How many in the last year that you were Sector Chief? Fewer than 8,600 encounters in Yuma.

In talking about extraordinarily foolish--I know that was said earlier by one of our witnesses--it is not just cities. It is counties, too. I have been nuking Charleston County sheriff over the last 24 hours over her lies about the illegals that are in South Carolina, her lies about releasing them into our state and that sort of thing. And when you are talking about New York, Mr. Biggs, if you talk to an NYPD officer, they will tell you they are not charging these illegals with crimes. And then when they do, they are released. They are not given a bail or bond when they go out. And so, the left, it is just all one big lie, and it is not right to the American people.\n\nAnd the statistic that crime is down for migrants, every illegal who is here, illegally entered our country illegally they literally committed a crime on the way in. And so, they are all 100 percent guilty of committing a crime. Mr. Chairman, I brought a folder today because I am going to enter in some documents into the congressional record this afternoon.\n\nSo, I want to thank our witnesses for being here today. I am going to focus my time on the human cost of sanctuary policies from local officials, including Charleston County sanctuary sheriff, Kristin Graziano, and I hope she is watching today. If she is watching, I hope you have a Number 2 pencil and you take notes because this is how I do my job. Charleston County, actually, my district, used to be a model for cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement. It is no more. Charleston County had a 287(g) cooperation agreement in place with ICE, acted as an over 72-hour detention facility for aliens apprehended by ICE, and worked together to enforce our Nation's laws and keep our community safe. No more because of sanctuary sheriff, Kristin Graziano. Unfortunately, in early 2021, the new sheriff of Charleston County, sanctuary sheriff, Kristin Graziano, began a systematic effort to dismantle immigration enforcement in Charleston County. Sheriff Graziano, on her first day in office, terminated Charleston County's 287(g) cooperation agreement with ICE. She announced this in front of a taco shop. I do not know why.\n\nSo, Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter this picture of Sheriff Graziano terminating her 287(g) agreement in front of El Pincho Taco into the record."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.050578Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:16:04.090431Z","inner_id":123,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":124,"annotations":[{"id":124,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"-pYL5bphaW","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"XlsinUH2As","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T13:16:05.860548Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:16:05.860577Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1.443,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"5392385f-8be0-4027-8543-ee52c0152599","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":124,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":124,"text":"Mr. Grothman Without objection."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.050652Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:16:05.909103Z","inner_id":124,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":125,"annotations":[{"id":125,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"0k28OJCjyw","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"_0bdkY4IIl","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T13:16:28.443883Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:16:28.443912Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":22.221,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"eb3fa255-9ebe-4ccc-9dfa-4c8b798e2be9","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":125,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":125,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you.

They are near Ajo, Arizona. And my understanding, it was less than a 10th of a mile from the border, there were several IEDs and RPGs. More than likely, based on my experience, that is for cartel infighting, taking over land, using it to, you know, emboldening their operations over there, but being that close to the U.S border, it is a threat. It is a threat to everybody in the region. It does not take much for somebody to turn an RPG or put an IED right there at the border and injure any of our CBP personnel or Border Patrol agents, so something like that, that close to our border, is a concern.

And then, also, I accessed this morning the CBP statistical data with regard to encounters on the Southwest land border alone."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.053796Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:24:46.027959Z","inner_id":167,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":168,"annotations":[{"id":168,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"aj1PQyTCe-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"7T05m3HeVL","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T13:24:49.143393Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:24:49.143422Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1.616,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"9a8c2cd7-5ec4-4603-a4a5-ec2aeb24ab44","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":168,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":168,"text":"Mr. Grothman Without objection."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.053872Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:24:49.190461Z","inner_id":168,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":169,"annotations":[{"id":169,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"KRAXY-2Kpz","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Mgd1frldy4","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T13:24:52.460926Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:24:52.460956Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.047,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"e6e2cd19-f41f-4dd6-98a6-3efa35d0e58c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":169,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":169,"text":"Mr. Sessions.

Thank you, guys, for coming on over and testifying here. What I can add, there is no question that we are at, in my mind, record numbers of people coming across the border for the current year. And you got to remember two new things: the CBP One app and the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela program, which were not around 2 years ago, but now each are taking on 125, one about 40,000, additional people coming here every month.\n\nSo, we are in a crisis never before. To say that this is like anything we have seen under President Trump is not true. And we have numbers on family units released, total encounters all going up, up over time. I can tell you, in my area, which is not a particularly liberal area, if I ask law enforcement how many people arrested who are here illegally, how many people in the jail are here illegally, how many people in a prison are here illegally--it amazes me what we do not know. OK. I do not think those numbers are out here because they are not out here in Wisconsin. They are sure not out here in Arizona or Texas or somewhere.\n\nThis is obviously going to permanently change America. We have not got into ideas of people coming here. I mean, we have to, over time, have people who understand our Constitution, believe in our values. As said before, we are right now among record numbers of people who are being sworn in, legally naturalized, way, way more than in the 60s or 70s or 50s, not even in the same ballpark. And nevertheless, we let this fiction sit out here that it is, you know, so difficult to come here.\n\nIn any event, it is, to me, obvious anecdotally and from talking to my local law enforcement, that people who are here illegally are committing crimes and serious crimes--rapes, that sort of thing--which is horrific. It is obviously true that when you bring another 5 million or 10 million people in the country and are not building more housing, you are going to drive up the cost of the housing that you have. I can tell you, from my district, even in Wisconsin, so far from the Southern border, some school districts have had dramatic increase in the number of people there, which obviously is very expensive, and it is more expensive than any other child because you are dealing with the additional cost connected with people not being able to speak English, but that is going up as well.\n\nSo, I appreciate you being here. I hope within the next few months, we are able to deal with this crisis and realize that you cannot be taking in 1.5 million or 2 million new people, 3 million new people every year, without fundamentally changing America. We have something so special here, and I feel like we are letting it slip away. So, thank you.\n\nWith that, and without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days to submit materials and additional written questions for the witnesses, which will be forwarded to the witnesses."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.054242Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:26:08.074719Z","inner_id":173,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":174,"annotations":[{"id":174,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Azjo_UgIbU","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"V4wa-0GFuj","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-16T13:26:12.227894Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:26:12.227925Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.704,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"13d3317b-2431-47a2-928d-2c5ce8387e22","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":174,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"cb4ba465-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":174,"text":"Mr. Grothman If there is no further business, without objection, the Subcommittee stands adjourned."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T12:21:29.054314Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T13:26:12.276834Z","inner_id":174,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":2,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
