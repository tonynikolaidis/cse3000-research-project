The Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation will now come to order, and we welcome you here this afternoon.\n\nWithout objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time, and I recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement.\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to this hearing on the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation.\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT just over a year ago, it has become clear AI could soon disrupt nearly every facet of our economy and society from healthcare to warfare. And that is good news. AI is a triumph of American innovation.\n\nIt is also likely to boost business productivity, raise our standard of living, and lead to life-saving and life-extending medical advances.\n\nBut like any powerful tool, AI could be used to inflict great harm when it is used carelessly or by malicious actors. That is why we have explored the dark side of AI in this Subcommittee, the risk that AI-fueled cyber-attacks pose to our national security and critical infrastructure, the threats to data privacy, the ways child sexual abuse material can proliferate online via deepfake technology, and the risk of personal harm to individuals from unchecked algorithmic bias.\n\nThese risks and others, including the rise and use of AI to weaponize biotechnology, are addressed in the broad reaching executive order on AI that President Biden signed on October 30.\n\nTwo days later, OMB followed on with a draft guidance specifically governing Federal agency use of AI. A brief comment period on that guidance ended yesterday. So, this is perfect timing for this hearing today.\n\nIn the EO, the President invokes extraordinary emergency powers, under the Defense Production Act, to require companies to notify the government about the development of powerful new AI systems and to share safety testing results.\n\nBut for the most part, both the EO and the OMB guidance tasks Federal agencies with mitigating against the dangers of specific, high-risk, AI-use cases as opposed to regulating the technology itself. That is a critical distinction.\n\nThe AI genie is out of the bottle, and it cannot be put back in. Suppressing core AI innovation here in the U.S. will not stop China from advancing the technology on its own, and if we fall behind China in the AI race, all other risks seem tame by comparison.\n\nAnd China, quite frankly, as you all know, is not far behind.\n\nThat is why our support measures in these documents that seek to spur the recruitment and retention of AI experts in both the private and public sector. Here in the Federal Government, we need employees who can responsibly partner with the private sector to procure AI systems that make our government smarter, smaller, and more effective.\n\nI look forward to hearing your views from industry witnesses today concerning how the OMB AI guidance is likely to impact Federal agencies' uses of AI and the ability of businesses to work with the government to provide cutting-edge AI tools that are safe and reliable.\n\nBut no one can yet judge the impact of the EO or the guidance. For the most part they are just kick-starting a process. The EO tasks Federal agencies with a massive laundry list of roughly 150 action items to take over the next year and beyond.\n\nDozens of regulations and guidance documents will be issued. Every major agency and many minor ones are enlisted in the effort, so we in Congress will be watching closely as this process unfolds.\n\nBut I am a little skeptical of Federal agencies that will keep to the timetable of action laid out in the documents because their track record is pretty useless. After all, the draft OMB guidance on government use of AI we are discussing today was due, by law, from this Administration more than 2 years ago, for example.\n\nWith that, I will now yield to the Ranking Member for his opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.038453Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:00:29.873475Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1070,"annotations":[{"id":1051,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"aRDKmgOikU","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"6_kPhLDQy4","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:02:03.976736Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:02:03.976767Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-18T09:01:44.688405Z","lead_time":92.44,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"09033192-2293-4035-a7d5-9f68463bbd3a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1070,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":2,"text":"Mr. Connolly Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and welcome to our panelists to today's hearing where we are making the world better one hearing at a time.\n\nA Qualcomm report published just last week estimates that the total economic benefit of generative AI amounts to roughly $6.1 trillion to $7.9 trillion. Hard to believe.\n\nSo, what does this AI-infused global economy look like, whatever the number?\n\nWe already know virtual AI assistants like Alexa and Siri. I use both. Lesser-known use cases include helping scientists develop clinical drugs to treat pulmonary fibrosis, defending bank customers from identity fraud, and improving traffic congestion for communities across the globe.\n\nWith these incredible advancements, AI also brings risks. In 2017, for example, researchers set out to train an AI model to identify cancerous lesions using clinical images. While researchers initially hailed the experiment a success, they subsequently realized that their algorithm's diagnoses were not informed by the lesion in the photo but rather by the presence of a dermatologist's ruler used to measure particularly concerning skin lesions.\n\nThat error could have been clearly a matter of life and death.\n\nThe United States must continue to invest in AI R&D and address those issues to solidify itself as a global leader.\n\nTen years ago, machines struggled to reliably identify images. Today national militaries are using AI analysis for satellite imagery, to determine missile and artillery strikes.\n\nAI has also grown its ability to understand and respond to language to the point where even Members of Congress are using ChatGPT.\n\nOver the past 10 years, the private sector has invested $249 billion into AI development, and the world's top 5 AI companies are headquartered in the United States.\n\nOn the public side, the National Science Foundation has announced a $140 million investment to establish seven new National Artificial Intelligence Research Institutes and to advance a cohesive approach to AI-related opportunities and risks.\n\nIn addition, agencies like NIH invested $5.9 million into the University of Virginia to fund research into how artificial intelligence could support care for diverse populations.\n\nThese investments can be important, if not critical, but the AI race remains competitive. If the U.S. fails to continue to support investment in this technology, we will be left behind, particularly by China.\n\nWhile traditional research and development tools like data and training models can improve technology, so can Federal Government leadership in setting standards, guidance, and regulatory frameworks.\n\nEstablishing clear and transparent rules of the road builds trust within the public and establishes user security and privacy protections.\n\nAI regulatory frameworks around the world will reflect the values of their own governments and societies, and those national frameworks matter because they will influence future iterations of AI.\n\nIn China, for example, the government requires AI companies to uphold core Socialist values in providing services. It is essential, therefore, that the United States lead in AI governance or the Nation risks ceding foundational control to adversarial forces eager to influence the future of AI.\n\nPresident Biden's executive order on the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of artificial intelligence, along with OMB's draft implementation guidance, do that.\n\nThese frameworks lead a comprehensive, society wide effort to ensure AI best serves and protects the American people. The President's EO builds on the important action that this Administration has taken on AI to date, including the creation of the blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights and the National Institute of Standards and Technology's AI risk management framework.\n\nAs the representative of the Silicon Valley East, I support provisions in the EO to bolster our Federal AI workforce. The President's accelerating hiring of AI professionals, while simultaneously offering AI training for employees at all levels of relevant fields, so the agency personnel are ready to confront the challenges both today and tomorrow.\n\nPresident Biden's executive order and OMB's draft implementation guidance are essential documents for implementing this technology safely and responsibly across the Federal Government and society broadly.\n\nCongress, industry, and the Administration must now work together to ensure that the Nation meets the important goals of the executive order and to continually seek to find and measure improved regulatory thresholds as needed as this technology evolves.\n\nThis Subcommittee looks forward to working with all stakeholders to encourage the safe and responsible development and usage of AI.\n\nWith that, I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.038591Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:02:04.025988Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1071,"annotations":[{"id":1052,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"o9_V7IA3y2","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"lSrgOR40jY","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:02:21.829332Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:02:21.829361Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":17.372,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"0f367196-2201-43b0-931f-1ddde2013678","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1071,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":3,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you.\n\nI am pleased today to introduce our witnesses for today's hearing.

My name is Samuel Hammond. I am the Senior Economist at the Foundation for American Innovation. We are a group of technologists and policy experts working to develop technology, talent, and ideas for a free and a more abundant future.\n\nFrom the printing press to the internet, history shows that transformative technologies are a key driver of institutional change and evolution. Artificial intelligence is no different. The only question is whether our government will keep up and adapt or become overwhelmed by the pace of change.\n\nThis is why I believe the risk from adopting AI in government must be balanced against even greater risks associated with failing to adopt AI proactively enough.\n\nEnter the White House's executive order on AI. A sprawling document, there is much to applaud in the executive order, from the streamlining of uses to attract and retain immigrants with AI expertise, to new initiatives for addressing Federal cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\n\nI was particularly impressed by the EO's focus on, quote, dual-use foundation models such as those that can be used to generate biologic agents, cyber weapons, or other catastrophic hazards to the American public.\n\nThe EO requires basic disclosures from large computing providers and the adoption of minimal safety testing for future, more powerful AI systems.\n\nYet more than anything, the bulk of the executive order is aimed at promoting the use of AI within government. Whether it is successful, only time will tell as right now it is mostly a series of requests and reports.\n\nMy worry, though, is that it does not go far enough and could even hinder the fulsome adoption of AI in government given excess focus on hypothetical harms and even deeper failure of imagination.\n\nOur institutions and AI are in an arms race, and we need to sprint just to stay in place. This is most obvious in the arena of cybersecurity where AI is both creating novel threats and more powerful forms of cyber defense.\n\nYet these arms-race dynamics extend far beyond cases where AI is explicitly misused. Even the most productive uses of AI will put unprecedented strain on our government.\n\nJust last week Google DeepMind published an AI model that discovered 380,000 new stable materials. This represents nearly 800 years' worth of new material science knowledge achieved virtually overnight.\n\nNow imagine what will happen when the same pace of change comes to medicine as it almost surely will. Is the FDA prepared to handle an order of magnitude increase in new drug discovery? The answer is clearly no, at least not under business as usual.\n\nSimilar bottlenecks exist through the Federal Government. In every case managing the AI transition will require government to not only adopt AI aggressively but may even force Congress to rethink the configuration of our administrative and regulatory agencies from the ground up.\n\nFrom broken procurement policies and cumbersome procedures, incremental reform is unlikely to suffice. We must modernize government at the firmware level and embrace AI and AI frameworks that truly scale, or risk government becoming the primary bottleneck to technological progress.\n\nEarlier this year OpenAI published a paper assessing the likely labor market impacts of large language models. They found jobs like accountants, auditors, and legal secretaries face an exposure rate of 100 percent.\n\nMany large companies have already begun downsizing, or have plans to downsize, in anticipation of the enormous efficiency gains unlocked by emerging AI tools and AI agents.\n\nMuch of the work performed in government bureaucracies is similar low-hanging fruit for AI. Congress should request an analogous survey to discover which Federal jobs are most exposed to AI automation or augmentation and to what extent legislation is needed to enable new, AI-enabled models of governance.\n\nThe goal should not be to downsize the Federal Government, per se, but rather to augment productivity and free up human resources for higher-value uses.\n\nGiven bureaucratic inertia, it is not enough to simply ask agencies to prioritize use of AI in government. Congress must push the Federal Government to adopt AI more aggressively, including by authorizing additional AI training resources, hiring authorities, and nimble funding for modernization.\n\nThe same tools for enhancing Federal capacity can be further used to strengthen congressional oversight. As agencies embrace AI internally, managers will be able to easily track and query the performance of their staff, automatically generating reports and work summaries from common document repositories.\n\nThese same techniques could be used to expedite reports to Congress and even enable near real time monitoring of an agency's activities. You could call it an Inspector General GPT.\n\nInnovating within government should mean more than just plugging AI into some existing outdated process and calling it a day. We need true inventiveness and ambition. So, while White House has taken some important first steps, there is much more to be done.\n\nThank you and I look forward to your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.038774Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:03:50.216990Z","inner_id":4,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1073,"annotations":[{"id":1054,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"nsy8DHD5K-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"u0FkurSZDI","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:03:51.374708Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:03:51.374737Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":0.794,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"140e491e-4089-475c-a09f-95f0806f413a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1073,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":5,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you.\n\nI will now recognize Dr. Ho to begin your opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.038846Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:03:51.423165Z","inner_id":5,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1074,"annotations":[{"id":1055,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"_VmY_4qAVp","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"kpQ1k0anQm","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:05:34.268222Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:05:34.268252Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-18T09:04:08.660399Z","lead_time":102.496,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"7c87196a-88b9-4c69-be32-7aa1b4975170","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1074,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":6,"text":"Dr. Ho Chairwoman Mace, Ranking Member Connolly, and Members of the Subcommittee, thanks for this opportunity to testify today.\n\nThere are three possible futures of AI. One is a future of AI abuse unchecked by government regulation. Nefarious actors use AI voice cloning to scam citizens, bot-generated texts to impersonate people, and deepfakes to erode trust.\n\nAnother is a future where the government harms citizens because of improper vetting of AI.\n\nBut a third future is possible where the government protects Americans from bad actors and leverages AI to make lives better, like the VA's use of AI to enable physicians to spend more time caring for veteran patients and less time taking notes.\n\nTo get to that future, we must make the right decisions today. The AI EO and OMB memo are important steps. Their focus on AI safety, investment, talent, and leadership are critical for America to lead in AI innovation and governance.\n\nBut the executive branch cannot achieve this goal fully without Congress. By our count, as Chairwoman Mace noted, the EO has some 150 requirements with urgent deadlines.\n\nBased on my research of prior AI-related EOs, the government needs sufficient resources, expertise, information, and flexibility to realize this vision. I, therefore, recommend six actions.\n\nFirst, Congress should support the EO's focus on top-level leadership from the White House and from the agency chief AI officers. Agencies will need resources and flexibility to not just put out fires but craft long-term strategic plans.\n\nSecond, Congress must support efforts to A, attract, train, and retain AI talented America; and B, provide pathways into the public service. Each year our universities are turning out a growing number of students with advanced degrees in AI. Yet fewer than 1 percent of AI Ph.Ds. pursue a career in public service. We need creative public-private partnerships to fix this talent gap.\n\nWhen the return of millions of overseas veterans after World War II threatened to overwhelm the VA hospital system, the VA developed a pipeline of medical students and faculty to provide veteran care.\n\nAt Stanford RegLab and HAI, we collaborate with government agencies to prototype exactly this kind of partnership in AI, and increasing mechanisms to partner and collaborate with universities will be critical.\n\nThird, a mandated, adverse event reporting system that requires parties to disclose AI harms would equip the government with information to ensure that AI is safe for the American public. Chairwoman Mace, for instance, has called for exactly this kind of information.\n\nSome calls for regulation have been driven by more speculative risks, such as how ChatGPT might facilitate bioweapons. Other harms are very real, such as erroneous loan denials, biased hiring algorithms, or malfunctioning self- driving cars.\n\nCurrently our government lacks unbiased information. Adverse event reporting, like what already exists for cybersecurity or medical devices, would ensure that the government can tell fact from fiction about real and emerging AI harms, and it would enable targeted regulation that avoids stifling innovation.\n\nFourth, the development of general-purpose foundation models should not be restricted through a licensing regime. Fears about the capabilities of these models have led some to argue that foundation models should only be developed by a few well equipped companies.\n\nThis is wrong. Licensing only a small number of companies would impede valuable safety research. The most important forms of accountability come from oversight by many.\n\nDone poorly, licensing would concentrate power, limit competition, and exacerbate the information gap between government and industry.\n\nFifth, government must appropriate funds to agencies and pass the bipartisan CREATE AI Act to fully authorize the National AI Research Resource and foster investment in R&D necessary for a wider range of Americans to participate in the AI revolution.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology is tasked with establishing the U.S. AI Safety Institute to develop verifiable and enforceable safety standards. Agencies like NIST must be sufficiently resourced to carry out these critical missions.\n\nSixth, government innovation should not be trapped in red tape. The OMB memo is exemplary in spelling out the opportunities and risks of AI, but process must be tailored to risk.\n\nFor instance, the memo's proposal that agencies allow everyone to opt out of AI for human review does not always make sense given the sheer variety of programs and uses of AI.\n\nSince 1965, the U.S. Postal Service, for instance, uses AI to read handwritten zip codes on envelopes. Opting out of this system would mean hiring thousands of employees just to read digits alone.\n\nHumans also make mistakes. Denials of SNAP benefits, for instance, are inaccurate 44 percent of the time. The government cannot ``human'' its way out of these problems. The government must build and leverage AI systems that complement human strengths and values.\n\nIn sum, the AI EO and OMB memo have taken a big first step, but it is only one step on the longer journey. Congress must now take it.\n\nThank you and I welcome your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.038933Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:05:34.319672Z","inner_id":6,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1075,"annotations":[{"id":1056,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"fzKPRkzugs","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"acOU7gPSN0","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:05:35.583531Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:05:35.583561Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":0.807,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"01239e23-fcb5-4ddb-a419-bc536010698d","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1075,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":7,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you.\n\nI now recognize Ms. Goodloe to please begin your opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.039005Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:05:35.633035Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1076,"annotations":[{"id":1057,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"WlaV4DQ5P1","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"CyNUSY7kHm","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:06:45.465597Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:06:45.465641Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":69.475,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"6be200f2-d1f3-414b-b27e-7b0f9d33bd49","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1076,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":8,"text":"Ms. Goodloe Good afternoon, Chairwoman Mace, Ranking Member Connolly, and Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Kate Goodloe, and I am Managing Director at BSA, the Software Alliance.\n\nBSA is a leading advocate for the global enterprise software industry. BSA members are at the forefront of developing cutting-edge services, including AI, and their products are used by businesses in every sector of the economy and by agencies across the Federal Government.\n\nI commend the Subcommittee for convening today's hearing, and I thank you for the opportunity to testify.\n\nThe United States needs a strong, clear, thoughtful approach to AI policy. Both Congress and the Administration have important roles in developing that policy. It is critical for the United States to get this right.\n\nThe benefits of AI are clear, as companies of all sizes in every industry use AI to improve safety, create better products, and serve their customers.\n\nThere are also significant risks if AI is not developed and deployed responsibly. AI policy should, one, protect individuals from real risks by creating durable safeguards that promote trust in AI; two, enable the government to benefit from AI technologies and deliver better public services; and three, position the United States as a leading voice in the global approach to responsible AI.\n\nThe benefits of getting this right are significant, including to promote the government's ability to procure and use tools like AI-powered cybersecurity services.\n\nThink about a Federal agency trying to protect both its network and the sensitive information it has about individuals, things like passport information, medical records, tax documents.\n\nWe already know bad actors are using AI to launch increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks. The government needs AI to stay ahead of those threats too.\n\nThe United States' AI policy should support important beneficial uses of AI that improve health, safety, national security while creating guardrails for high-risk uses.\n\nThe recent executive order takes an ambitious whole-of- government approach to AI policy. I want to highlight several of the positive steps it takes to advance responsible AI.\n\nThe executive order recognizes the importance of the AI risk management framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We encourage the Administration to ensure that framework anchors the government's risk management efforts.\n\nThe executive order also recognizes the importance of AI in cyber defense. It launches a pilot program to implement the National AI Resource to give researchers access to compute power and training resources.\n\nIt recognizes the importance of content authenticity, tools, and standards to help people know when content is real and when it has been altered, and it promotes the coordinated enforcement of civil rights statutes across agencies.\n\nOther parts of the order create notable, important obligations with effects that will depend on how they are implemented. We encourage the Administration to consult with stakeholders, including industry, to ensure those obligations work in practice and do not undermine the order's goals.\n\nI will give two examples. First, are new reporting requirements, which will apply to companies that develop certain potential dual-use foundation models and entities that acquire or possess large scale computing clusters.\n\nSecond, are new know-your-customer obligations for U.S. infrastructure-as-a-service providers, who must report certain transactions with foreign persons to the Department of Commerce and pass on those obligations to their foreign resellers.\n\nThe executive order also addresses government use and procurement of AI which are the focus of the draft guidance by the Office of Management and Budget. My written testimony includes BSA's recommendations for improving that guidance, including to ensure it applies consistently across agencies.\n\nIt is also important to coordinate OMB's changes with five concurrent regulatory updates that affect how the government procures AI. Failing to do so can undermine the government's goal of effectively leveraging AI.\n\nThe executive order is much broader than these efforts. It tasks more than 40 Federal agencies and entities with drafting reports, conducting consultations, and developing rules.\n\nDespite this ambitious approach, the order does not replace the need for congressional action on AI. Congress should play a leading role in setting the United States' AI policy in at least two ways.\n\nFirst, Congress should pass legislation that ensures the NIST framework guides the government's use and procurement of AI systems.\n\nSecond, Congress should enact legislation that establishes new safeguards for private sector companies that develop and deploy high-risk AI. These actions can help to create a strong, clear, and thoughtful United States AI policy.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.039091Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:06:45.513956Z","inner_id":8,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1077,"annotations":[{"id":1058,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"pqd1I14SRJ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"oc4mCnVqJJ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:06:48.222079Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:06:48.222108Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.345,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"1e59ae6d-d0d3-4af9-abd8-f31b5179b3b0","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1077,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":9,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you.\n\nI will now recognize Mr. Nodurft for your opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.039160Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:06:48.271893Z","inner_id":9,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1078,"annotations":[{"id":1059,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"0JB2tvrw6P","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"sbGSNJUWLT","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:08:05.908896Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:08:05.908925Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-18T09:07:36.199390Z","lead_time":77.297,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"2c33f619-9212-4e62-a9d1-09a49eba27d6","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1078,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":10,"text":"Mr. Nodurft Thank you, Chairwoman Mace, Ranking Member Connolly, and Members of the Committee for holding this important hearing today. My name is Ross Nodurft. I am the Executive Director for the Alliance for Digital Innovation. We are a coalition of innovative commercial companies whose mission is to bring IT modernization and emerging technologies to the government.\n\nMy prior experience includes working at the Office of Management and Budget, in the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer, as well as working in the private sector with many companies to modernize their technology, bring in Cloud services, cybersecurity products, and now artificial intelligence tools.\n\nAs the Executive Director of the Alliance for Digital Innovation, I represent leading technology, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cybersecurity, and professional service providers, all working with the public sector.\n\nADI focuses on four key areas in our advocacy efforts-- accelerating technology modernization in government, enabling acquisition policies that make sense to bring in innovative technologies, promoting cybersecurity innovations to better protect the public and the private sector, and then improving the public sector's technology workforce.\n\nRegarding the Administration's recent AI policies, overall, ADI is supportive of any legislation or administrative policy that promotes adoption and use of modern Cloud-based commercial technology to increase the pace of government mission delivery.\n\nWe are also very supportive of the efforts to provide a public comment period for a draft memo. We understand that that is not something that is done traditionally, and we really support that effort.\n\nHowever, there was a really short turnaround time that is limiting the amount of thoughtful and constructive feedback that industry can provide.\n\nIn fact, the rushed nature of the response mean OMB will be finalizing its guidance to agencies without the full benefit of insights that can be provided by the industry partners that are developing and deploying the AI capabilities in partnership with the government.\n\nThat said, ADI believes there are several important key areas that the administration should clarify as it updates its guidance.\n\nThe OMB memo could inadvertently keep innovative businesses away from the public sector. The OMB memo creates a series of fractured and unevenly administered new processes across departments and agencies that will deter many companies, including small and midsize technology companies, from working with the Federal Government.\n\nTo solve for this, OMB should provide additional specificity about various trigger mechanisms for determining which technologies are considered rights-impacting and which technologies are considered safety-impacting.\n\nIt should create a repository for the reuse of various products or testing documents.\n\nAnd then they should consider certain use cases, like specific cybersecurity-use cases, to call out as neither rights-impacting, nor safety-impacting, and proactively exempt those products and services from the minimum requirements.\n\nGovernment should use current government processes for AI. We cannot have agencies trying to implement the new processes without fully considering how they fit into current technology and security governance regimes, and how they are optimized for AI adoption.\n\nWe strongly encourage the Administration to provide agencies with enough time to optimize their plans for adoption and use of AI, leveraging current governance processes before providing their plans to comply with the executive order.\n\nThe government should prioritize specific AI-use cases. AI technology is not new. It has been around in many forms for many years. ADI believes that OMB must help agencies prioritize governance processes that focus on delivery of new AI or generative AI capabilities and to distinguish from those existing AI and machine learning capabilities that are already authorized and in use in the Federal Government.\n\nThe government must refine definitions and trigger mechanisms for rights-and safety-impacting systems. ADI recommends further refining safety-and rights-impacting definitions to delineate harms associated with specific categories.\n\nExamples for safety-impacting could be loss of life or serious physical harm, while rights-impacting examples could be tied to harms that are currently protected by existing laws such as nondiscrimination and consumer protection.\n\nIn addition to further defining the risks, ADI believes that OMB must better define the term ``meaningful impact'' which acts as the trigger mechanism for such harms.\n\nFinally, the government should clarify data ownership and focus on outcome-based testing. OMB should clearly state that the company data and proprietary, personal information does not have to be disclosed to the government for review.\n\nAdditionally, OMB should clarify that assessing the quality and the appropriateness of relevant data does not mean reviewing the underlying training data when reviewing AI systems but instead allows for a summary description of the characteristics of the training design data and ensuring that that will meet the requirement.\n\nFinally, ADI recommends that OMB focus on model testing, known limitations, guidelines for intended use, and example- performance results of an AI model.\n\nThank you again to the Committee for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.039256Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:08:05.960952Z","inner_id":10,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1079,"annotations":[{"id":1060,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"vSXGm0P2Fi","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"WU2VJN4Ywv","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:08:07.145949Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:08:07.145978Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":0.807,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"b7c28a83-1c4b-4a04-82b4-6119f5de4279","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1079,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":11,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you.\n\nI will now recognize Dr. Chowdhury to please begin her opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.039327Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:08:07.194021Z","inner_id":11,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1080,"annotations":[{"id":1061,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"GeRenW8uKO","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"hbMuUNaDAt","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:09:20.653091Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:09:20.653120Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-18T09:08:20.144426Z","lead_time":73.014,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"97841617-3cc6-44a6-9fff-9e6348560c9a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1080,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":12,"text":"Dr. Chowdhury Chairwoman Mace, Ranking Member Connolly, and esteemed Members of the Committee, my name is Dr. Rumman Chowdhury, and I am a data scientist and social scientist who has built AI, and responsible AI, within and without industry for the past decade.\n\nThe executive order and the subsequent OMB guidance lay out an ambitious strategy for the accelerated responsible deployment of AI.\n\nI applaud the recognition that, in order for the U.S. to remain an AI superpower, it must focus on safe, secure, and trustworthy use. I offer the following recommendations to facilitate this goal.\n\nFirst, the U.S. must remain an active leader in the global AI landscape by funding targeted interventions and responsible AI for public and global use;\n\nSecond, in order to achieve the goals of section 4 of the EO, support and fund NIST;\n\nThird, develop the independent community of algorithmic auditors by enabling secure-model access and investing in education for structured, public feedback methods such as red- teaming and bias bounties;\n\nFourth, develop a minimum requirement standard that includes a determination of whether or not AI adoption is necessary and appropriate for Federal Government use.\n\nFirst, countries are moving quickly to establish global standards and best practices around responsible use. I arrived this morning from Singapore's AI for Global Good workshop.\n\nTheir government gathered AI experts from around the world to help co-create ten projects that they will fund for open use and global benefit.\n\nThey are not alone. I have collaborated on similar efforts in London, Brussels, Paris, and Oslo, where there is similar investment in global, responsible-use best practices.\n\nThe U.S. must continue to set global AI priorities in alignment with section 11 of the EO. I recommend that the government similarly invest in public interest projects for responsible use that are open access, publicly available, and drive as a resource for individuals around the world.\n\nSecond, simply put, support NIST. Section 4 of the EO develops an ambitious strategy to leverage the institutional authority and capacity of NIST and expand their remit. I can think of no better team to execute on this plan.\n\nWith a limited timeline and broad scope, they require significant funding and resources to deliver the global, standard-setting quality that NIST is known for.\n\nSimilar institutes are funded accordingly. The U.K. AI Safety Institute has 100 million pounds earmarked for their endeavors. The Norwegian Government has allocated a 1 billion kroner fund toward AI development.\n\nIn addition, the proposed U.S. AI Safety Institute must remain housed as NIST. As a scientific measurement body, they provide much needed empirical evidence data to help us understand and prioritize how we address the risks and harms introduced by AI systems.\n\nThe U.S. Safety Institute must focus on a wide range of harms--societal impact, bias and discrimination, as well as broader considerations of future risks--in order to provide the full breadth of assurance we need to safely deploy AI. We already have significant evidence of AI systems in use today that infringe upon basic civil and human rights.\n\nThird, in June, I testified to the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee on the topic of AI. At that time the concept of red-teaming was known by cybersecurity and few others.\n\nSince then, it has become a topic of much consideration, mentioned 15 times in the EO alone. This is due, in part, to the White House's support of the generative AI red-teaming exercise this past August, which was co-led by my organization, Humane Intelligence.\n\nWe need to continue that momentum and enthusiasm. Newly appointed chief AI officers, as required by the draft OMB guidance, should engage with trusted organizations, including the Safety Institute, as well as independent external organizations to develop red-teaming as a part of standard vendor procurement and project-evaluation processes.\n\nFourth, AI is often a hammer in search of a nail. We cannot assume that AI is always the best answer to a problem as developers optimize for efficiency rather than effectiveness.\n\nWe have already seen how the use of AI infringes upon civil rights by algorithmic discrimination in criminal justice, employment, banking, and more.\n\nIn 1971, the Supreme Court addressed a similar problem-- unintentional employment discrimination introduced by aptitude tests. The Griggs v. Duke Power Company ruling enabled the disparate impact requirement that is today widely used in evaluating AI hiring systems.\n\nIn order to achieve the goals of sections 7 and 8 of the executive order, I recommend a similar approach for the use of AI in high-risk situations in order to mitigate unintended consequences due to algorithmic bias.\n\nA minimum standards test could include the following: A determination of whether or not an AI system performs better than an equal investment in improving the current system; requiring alignment with impact metrics designed with NIST to measure the effectiveness and robustness of the system, not just performance efficiency; a strategy to proactively identify and address real-world biases and adverse outcomes through in- context testing methods like expert or public red-teaming.\n\nIn conclusion, we must be circumspect on if, when, and how we adopt AI systems. This technology is meant to serve humanity, and innovation is only possible if we are all able to reap the benefits.\n\nThank you for your time."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.039415Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:09:20.700735Z","inner_id":12,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1081,"annotations":[{"id":1062,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"qU20-a1io0","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"IO4JaDh9jR","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:09:28.055977Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:09:28.056006Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":6.984,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"bb5dc13c-562b-4768-8026-8c8072740c86","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1081,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":13,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you so much.\n\nI now ask unanimous consent to enter into the record three letters from the following organizations: Americans for Prosperity, Consumer Technology Association, and the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\nAnd without objection, so ordered."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.039499Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:09:28.107449Z","inner_id":13,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1082,"annotations":[{"id":1063,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"if0Zr3V9dD","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"0uiBGxrPsc","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:09:52.963440Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:09:52.963476Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":24.492,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"fd392764-2810-43d2-8a12-9f03ee0d6490","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1082,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":14,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you.

Yes, I think it is both a national security issue and a sort of good- government issue. So, you mentioned COBOL. We lived through the pandemic, and when you saw those line-ups around the block to claim unemployment insurance, a big part of that was because state unemployment insurance systems are built on mainframe computing technology from 50, 60 years ago.\n\nIt is broader than that as well. You know, look at the IRS. The IRS individual master file, which is sort of the core file that determines individual and business tax returns, was coded in assembly. So, even more primitive than COBOL, it was from the Kennedy Administration.\n\nAnd so, these systems, in addition to cybersecurity, present sort of risks from through-put in denial of service.

But now instead of just being expletives, they are fully cogent, well written comments that under the Administrative Procedures Act, we all have to read and respond to.\n\nThose kinds of sort of tsunamis of information, even if they are not explicitly misused, could easily overwhelm an agency. And so, you know, in that case, maybe we need to adopt AI for summarizing comments or something like that.\n\nI also think of this in the context of information requests.

As we witness the rapid advancements in AI technology, it becomes increasingly clear that a patchwork of disjointed regulations is not sufficient to address the complex challenges and ethical considerations that AI presents.\n\nEarlier this year, NIST released its AI risk management framework. The AI RMF will give companies, agencies, and others who utilize AI a common resource when adopting risk management programs.\n\nThis will align and coordinate AI risk management across organizations. It is a step in a right direction.\n\nMs. Goodloe, you mentioned the importance of the NIST RMF in your testimony.

The NIST framework is a significant accomplishment, and one benefit of the NIST framework is, it allows organizations to adopt risk management practices that have the same structure so that they have a common approach to managing AI risks and they have a common language for managing those risks.\n\nIn our view, the risk management framework developed by NIST should anchor how agencies use and procure AI systems. When agencies and their vendors adopt risk management practices based on the RMF, they speak the same language, and they can better coordinate and manage risks across entities."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.042704Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:20:01.185068Z","inner_id":56,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1125,"annotations":[{"id":1118,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"85ebAoPQtW","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"cGZpDhh7zU","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:20:11.372588Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:20:11.372618Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":9.838,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"797215e8-a399-40f2-a3a6-9b4182fa97d8","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1125,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":57,"text":"Mr. Timmons Thank you for that.\n\nAnd how can the OMB's approach to AI be improved through congressional action to assist in the harmonization of the litany of issues you raised in your written testimony?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.042774Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:20:11.420067Z","inner_id":57,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1126,"annotations":[{"id":1119,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"WYWgyCcLzm","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"TJC01EFQPm","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:20:39.991909Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:20:39.991940Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":28.231,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"c8edf1c4-6ef9-4b6b-ac77-21ea3610cf9b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1126,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":58,"text":"Ms. Goodloe In our view, the OMB memo is a significant achievement in taking a risk-based approach to AI risk management, but it can be improved in several ways, and my written testimony highlights them.\n\nFirst, there is a need for a governmentwide approach to procurement of AI systems.\n\nSecond, there Is a need for a uniform definition of the types of AI systems that are subject to this memo.

BASIC was invented by Microsoft without any guidelines or any rules or anything that was passed by an executive order. SQL--again, by IBM--and then lately, Apple created Swift. All of this has been done by the creative forces in the private sector.\n\nSo, my question to the panel--and we will just begin with Mr. Hammond at the beginning--is, do you have any concerns?

And I think we have to be very careful about--before we even think about regulating AI, we have to first figure out how our own existing laws today already apply.\n\nYou cannot create bioweapons as it is today. Why would AI be any different? AI obviously could not be helpful in that either.\n\nSo, I think we have to be very careful and thoughtful so that we do not stifle innovation because we want the United States to lead around the world. We do not want China to catch up with us, and in order for that to happen, we have to keep innovating.\n\nAnd I think knowing what I know now, as a sophomore 2.5 years in here up on the Hill, is that the Federal Government moves like just the slowest dinosaur. I mean, we are still on mainframe computers and legacy systems, and we should not be. How in the hell do we think we could make advances in AI vis-`- vis the government? I mean, that is just not ever going to happen.\n\nAnd so, I think we have got to be very careful about it, but it is worth having this discussion on how we try to protect people, consumers, or data in the Federal Government, et cetera. How can we use AI to advance the ball in many ways and take what is going on in the private sector and using it in the public sector?\n\nAnd I think we are going to have to rely on--significantly rely on the private sector to--what does ethical AI look like? Because they are the ones that are going to have to take the lead.\n\nAnd I would call on industry today in AI to take the lead. What does that look like? And encourage industry and companies to work together on that framework and what that might look like in the future.\n\nAnd with that, I will yield to my Ranking Member."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.051132Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:27:33.151193Z","inner_id":83,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1152,"annotations":[{"id":1192,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"58sqKIuG6b","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"OzsjlMgZSG","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:28:29.306834Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:28:29.306867Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":55.671,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"ef20d148-b0a1-4a8f-83c1-beca6029d517","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1152,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":84,"text":"Mr. Connolly Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. This has been a most illuminating hearing and really thoughtful.\n\nI want to just say to my friend before he leaves, I think he makes a really good point about what could be achieved with sort of unimpeded private sector research.\n\nBut I would say to my friend, we have to acknowledge, as Dr. Ho did, that the Federal Government has some stunning successes in its own research and development. We would not have the internet but for what was called DARPANET for 25 years, a 100-percent-funded Federal R&D project.\n\nWe would not have mapped the human genome without a 100- percent-federally funded research project, which is going to transform medicine. We would not have GPS, which is now universal but was a classified Department of Defense technology until we decided to open it up commercially. We would not have radar. There is a whole string.\n\nSometimes the narrative of the Federal Government is really skewed. I do not mean to suggest my friend did that. He was pointing out the positive aspects of private sector unimpeded, and I agree with that. I come from the private sector, too.\n\nBut we have to acknowledge the Federal Government has done some spectacular things. The internet. How do you even put--how do you put an ROI on the internet? What has the return on that investment been? I think it is approaching infinity because it has transformed the whole world. It is very hard to put a dollar figure on it, but thank God we made that investment. And I just point that out.\n\nMr. Hammond talked about the pace. We have to be concerned about the pace because we are in a race not only with the natural evolution of this technology, but with competitors who are accelerating or exploiting that pace.\n\nI listened to a podcast today--I think it was just in the last week--with Elon Musk. And he was asked, well, on the pace and evolution of AI, when do you think we arrive at a point where AI overtakes human intelligence? The smartest brain on the planet, AI can do better. And his answer was within 3 years. Not 30. Three.\n\nSo, we do have challenges, and keeping up with that and making sure that we get it right--as you said, Ms. Goodloe, we have got to get it right. We do not want to impede. We do not want to thwart or, you know, suppress, but on the other hand, we want to protect.\n\nAnd we want to try to anticipate how we channel AI into purposeful and positive, you know, betterment for the quality of human life while protecting humans from the worst it could produce, and getting that right is going to be a big challenge. And as the Chairwoman said, we are going to need the private sector as a partner as we proceed to do this.\n\nThank you so much for being here, and thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for this hearing."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.051225Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:28:29.356235Z","inner_id":84,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1153,"annotations":[{"id":1193,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"EPnBWBlHtT","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"sIeE_zoDJm","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:28:32.915383Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:28:32.915412Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.143,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"aa894c73-4fc3-44e4-91dd-1581c0edf291","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1153,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":85,"text":"Ms. Mace.

Of course, I have seen you on the SST Committee.\n\nThe President's October 2023 executive order on AI acknowledges that, to appreciate the benefits of AI technology, we have to first mitigate substantial risk it poses of perpetuating existing biases. The individuals who are most marginalized in our community, such as those with disabilities, are left most vulnerable to these risks.\n\nIn my district, an Associated Press investigation found that the family risk predictor tool used by a child protective services agency harbored potential bias against people with disabilities. The civil rights repercussions of these opaque AI tools, or black boxes, are alarming, and those impacted are left with little to no options for recourse.\n\nSo, we must approach AI development and implementation with ample caution to ensure that the technology serves everyone equitably. For this to happen, diversity and inclusion must be fundamental at every stage of AI development process.\n\nDr. Chowdhury, how can we ensure that diversity and inclusion ultimately influence the outcomes of AI systems?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:40:20.051358Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:28:50.685548Z","inner_id":86,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1155,"annotations":[{"id":1197,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"x-xTn7YoPo","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"syT2Z8Y5mS","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T09:29:01.443869Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T09:29:01.443900Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":10.39,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"77530fe3-ac27-4475-b8af-941a176e1929","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1155,"project":8,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"b5091b82-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":87,"text":"Dr. Chowdhury Thank you for the question.

And I could not help but notice that, of the agencies that have named chief AI officers, only the NSF has a woman at the lead. And this matters. This matters in industry. This matters in government as well. I encourage the government to seek diverse candidates to set direction and perspective.\n\nSecond, there must be checks for diverse data. In engineering, we have this phrase, ``garbage in, garbage out.'' AI is simply a reflection of the data and the design decisions that have been made to create the system.\n\nOverwhelmingly, we see AI systems reflect the biases that exist in society. For example, there was a kidney allocation algorithm that discriminated against Black patients because of a history of systemic discrimination by doctors.\n\nAnd finally, there needs to be testing--such as red teaming--for minority perspectives when relevant for the use of the product.
