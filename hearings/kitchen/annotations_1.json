I want to welcome everybody for joining us today.\n\nWithout objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time.\n\nI recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement.\n\nOver the last 3 1\/2 years into the Biden-Harris Administration, many Americans are asking themselves a very important question. I remember when I was a kid in the 1980 campaign, challenger, Governor Ronald Reagan, looked at folks and asked, ``Are you better off now than you were 4 years ago,'' and I think every American should ask themselves that question when they go to the polls in the coming month and a half. Vice President Harris struggles to answer this question because she knows in most parts of the country, the answer is an emphatic no. As we have discussed in this subcommittee a year ago, Bidenomics has had a devastating effect for families across this country and their ability to plan for the future. Households have watched their paychecks disappear, while seeing the costs of goods and services rise. While President Biden claims his economic policy is restoring the American Dream, too many find this dream just out of touch.\n\nSince the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, total inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, has risen 20.2 percent. Estimates show that Americans must now spend over $11,000 more each year to have the same quality of life that they had in January 2021. Grocery prices for goods, such as bread, poultry, and cereal, have all increased in price by 20 percent and eggs nearly 50 percent. Gasoline used to transport these goods, that has increased by almost 50 percent, further driving costs up. Housing costs for mortgages and rent have both increased. Average rent prices are now 24 percent higher. Mortgage rates have doubled, making it nearly impossible for young Americans to afford their first home.\n\nReal wages, and this is very important, real wages for workers are also lower since the start of the Biden-Harris Administration, further straining the ability to keep pace with rising prices. Businesses are struggling to cope with the $1.7 trillion in new regulatory costs that the Biden-Harris Administration has imposed on the American economy. This Administration has engaged in massive regulatory overreach in an attempt to fundamentally alter or kill almost every energy and manufacturing industry job in that sector.\n\nThis morning, the committee released a new report entitled ``Death by a Thousand Regulations: The Biden-Harris Administration's Campaign to Bury America in Red Tape.'' I ask unanimous consent to enter that into the record.\n\nWithout objection, so ordered.\n\nThis report details the Committee's findings on how the Biden-Harris Administration's avalanche of costly regulations impact both businesses and consumers. The report also highlights effective legislative solutions this Committee has been advancing to provide necessary reforms to the regulatory process.\n\nOf course, the Biden-Harris regulatory onslaught is not the only way this Administration has tried to impose their left- wing agenda on Americans. Last Congress, the Administration, with the help from congressional Democrats, spent trillions of taxpayer dollars driving inflation and weakening our economy. The ``Inflation Reduction Act'' and the ``American Rescue Plan'' did not reduce inflation or rescue Americans--it did the opposite. Yet, Vice President Harris says Bidenomics is working, and both of these massive spending packages were simply slush funds for left-wing causes. The other side of the aisle wants to obscure the truth, claiming that greedflation, or corporate greed, is the invisible force driving these hardships. They want to ignore how the Biden-Harris Administration's massive regulatory overreach and government spending are hurting the American people. They are not interested in transparency or accountability.\n\nSo, today we have--all of Congress we continue to shine the light on the Biden-Harris Administration. We will hold this Administration accountable for the $1.7 trillion in new regulatory costs upon the economy at a time when it was needed the very least. We will hold the Biden-Harris Administration accountable for the hidden taxes on consumers as businesses navigate these bureaucratic hurdles, raising prices, lowering wages to stay afloat. We will hold the Biden-Harris Administration accountable for their destruction of the American Dream for so many, and really, too many Americans, and Americans deserve answers.\n\nThey are frustrated and believe their government is not listening to them when they sound the alarm on the economy. And you see this in the polls as to who can handle the economy better, and they are not polling well at all. Americans deserve better, and we need to do better if we have any hope in what we all want for ourselves and our children, which is to live the American Dream.\n\nOur expert panel of witnesses is here to dispel many of the myths spun by the Biden-Harris Administration and offer their insights into how we can right the wrongs of the Biden-Harris Administration's economic policies. I want to thank the witnesses for appearing before the Subcommittee to share their insights, and I look forward to this discussion. And on an editor's note, I think it is very interesting that this Administration has been known since its inception as the ``Biden-Harris Administration,'' but now the Vice President wants you to forget about the hyphen and the ``Harris.'' I now recognize Ranking Member Stansbury for an opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:56.896266Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T11:37:57.499001Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":781,"annotations":[{"id":271,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"V3Z6MRvtak","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"1PMcxnpKvp","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"xzeBkh-WkQ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"btxYi5INEr","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"XGswj9BFPU","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"kW0kdhku5S","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"4kiJCHlt3t","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:41:35.085585Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T11:41:35.085618Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-05T11:38:23.198565Z","lead_time":217.244,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"54a620cb-545e-4e34-ae6c-4c2f743df6ed","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":781,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":2,"text":"Ms. Stansbury All right. Well good morning, everyone. Thank you to the Chairman. I want to welcome everyone to the Oversight Committee, and if it has not been apparent in the opening remarks, we are 41 days from the Presidential election because the Oversight Committee has been using this Committee, speaking of slush funds, as a slush fund for Donald Trump campaign.\n\nSo, here we are once again. We had a similar hearing last week in which the Committee Majority brought in witnesses who are tied to Project 2025 and tied to both the former, and what I think Donald Trump would hope would be his future, Administration to talk about and to platform their extreme agenda that would take away American rights and that will misrepresent what is happening in our economy, what has happened over the last several years, all in the name of impugning the Vice President, who, of course, is on the ballot with Donald Trump. So, you are going to hear a lot of things today. Most of them are probably not based in facts, economics, ways in which this country is actually structured. So, I want to just take the opportunity to kind of set the record straight from the top.\n\nOur colleagues today are going to promote a false narrative that the Biden-Harris Administration policies are all about hurting American consumers, that they are driving inflation, that they have destroyed our economy. Of course, Americans are struggling right now. We have just faced a historic pandemic. Many Americans were struggling before the pandemic. We are still recovering from it. But the truth of the matter is that the United States has amongst the lowest inflationary rates of any industrialized country in the world right now, and it is because of the American Recovery Plan, because of the historic legislation that the Biden-Harris Administration has put into place, and that the previous Congress, under Democratic leadership, passed, that we were able to stop some of the more devastating impacts of the pandemic and the devastating impacts of the previous Administration. So, the exact opposite is true.\n\nWe have seen over the course of the Biden-Harris Administration that they inherited an economic mess. It was both the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was also the impacts of what happened under the previous Administration. And if you roll back the tape, of course, you will see that during the Trump Administration, he advocated for the largest tax giveaway in American history to the wealthiest individuals and large corporations, which has helped to drive not only extreme impacts on the U.S. economy, but enrich the wealth of individuals and corporations at the expense of the working people of this country. Under the Trump Administration, unemployment skyrocketed to nearly 15 percent. It was the highest since the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting data in 1948--the highest--that is outrageous.\n\nAnd then as soon as he took office, President Biden worked with Congress to pass meaningful legislation to get it under control. We passed the American Rescue Plan, which not only helped millions of Americans get through one of the largest economic disturbances in American history, but also through one of the largest pandemics in which the former President was telling people to swallow bleach to deal with COVID-19 and telling them to take horse pills. If we want to talk about the economy, talk about facts. Let us actually talk about facts.\n\nI want to just emphasize some of the important pieces of legislation that have helped the United States get inflation and our economy back on track. It was not just that Biden- Harris came in under this set of extenuating circumstances. President Biden had a vision of the future of this country. He had a vision for bringing back American jobs to this country and helped to pass the CHIPS and Science Act, which is one of the most important modern manufacturing bills, as well as the national security bill, to make sure that we are manufacturing Made in America goods here on American soil. That is creating thousands of jobs and helping to bring manufacturing back to our rural communities, including in mine.\n\nHe passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, which is building water lines and broadband and roads and bridges all across America. And he passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which extended healthcare to millions of Americans which states had refused to provide expanded Medicaid to, and so our lowest- income individuals across the country are actually having access to healthcare for the first time.\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act was also a historic investment in the future of this country. It is an investment in our economy as we make a transition to an energy economy that is clean and that solves our climate crisis. Right now, we are seeing millions of dollars being pumped into our communities that is revitalizing local jobs, that is bringing home manufacturing, and that is employing thousands of New Mexicans and millions of Americans across the country.\n\nNow, the question is, how do we translate these economic gains into the real lived experiences of New Mexicans and Americans across the country? It is easy for politicians to come here and to explain to the American people how hard it is to put food on the table and a roof over their head. I grew up in a working family. I grew up in a family that struggled to get by, that struggled to make ends meet. And had it not been, during times of crisis when we could depend on resources to help us with housing and to pay for utility bills and to help put food on the table, I would not be sitting here as a Congresswoman today. We know that these programs help lift American people out of poverty, and we know that they stimulate the economy.\n\nSo, I will just say, as we embark on what I am sure will be an interesting journey into false and fun facts this morning, that the American people are smart. Do not be fooled by what you are hearing here today. This is yet another campaign opportunity that the Majority is using to platform and advance Donald Trump's extreme agenda, and I do not think the American people are going to buy it. So, thanks. I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:56.896392Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T11:41:35.121509Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":782,"annotations":[{"id":272,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"lKEAhRkSl1","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Soj8X9N84j","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"9knLxPMiiX","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"fL6u7uKq6J","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Z-mDHaZlAj","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"HuSpLSS9Uq","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"JhyshlBXWE","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:41:42.881915Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T11:41:42.881941Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.442,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"6d15e0b8-87c9-4109-a8fe-d0433e46d691","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":782,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":3,"text":"Mr. Fallon Thank you.

There were lots of very important points that were made by both sides.\n\nEach year, the White House Council of Economic Advisors submits an Economic Report of the President. The ERP outlines the Administration's key economic goals and strategies to achieve them, serving as a crucial part of the Federal budget process. The 2022 ERP, the first under this Administration, established the primary goal of ``restoring the public sector as a partner in long-run growth.'' This objective focuses on new ways of integrating the government into the economy based on a concept that Federal investment is foundational to economic growth.\n\nBased on virtually any metric, the Biden-Harris Administration has succeeded in growing the size and scope of the Federal Government. After the 2020 pandemic surge in Federal spending, debt as a percent of the economy briefly declined, but from April 2021 onward, it has consistently grown. Federal hiring has hit all-time highs, and state and local government employment has grown significantly, supported by Federal subsidies. Furthermore, new regulations from the Administration have added considerable cost to the private sector, as Chairman Fallon noted, $1.7 trillion in regulatory costs and $325 million in paperwork hours. The Biden-Harris Administration's economic strategy is founded on the belief that public spending is the engine of job creation, income growth, and wealth. However, this approach has contributed to both rising costs and ineffective government. It has also hindered the broader capacity of economic policy to create an environment that fosters economic opportunity.\n\nA more effective approach to economic policy would involve focusing on full employment, low inflation, and sustainable growth. Policymakers should also harness American entrepreneurship to drive innovation, job creation, and wealth generation. Ensuring market competition while limiting government regulation to essential safety standards would encourage economic dynamism and reduce costs for consumers.\n\nInflation remains one of the most significant issues facing Americans today. As of July 2024, it takes about $1.20 to purchase what $1 bought in January 2021. Although some have blamed corporate price gouging, research indicates that tight labor markets and large budget deficits are the primary drivers of inflation. The tight labor market, which saw job vacancies outpacing unemployment, contributed to wage inflation and price increases. Additionally, fewer workers have returned to the work force following the pandemic, with around 2.9 million fewer people employed today than pre-pandemic trends would suggest. The shortage of workers, particularly among younger cohorts, and particularly among young, male cohorts, has lowered productivity, reduced government revenues, and increased the Federal deficit.\n\nDeficit spending is another major cause of inflation. Since 2020, 76 percent of new government spending has been financed by debt. Fourteen percent has been financed by printing money. Together, tight labor markets and deficit spending can explain about 80 percent of the increase in core inflation that has occurred since the beginning of 2021. Inflation has been further exacerbated by the Inflation Reduction Act. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the IRA increased spending by $110 billion and the deficit by $60 billion between 2022 and 2026, compounding inflationary pressures that were already in motion. Furthermore, the Administration has been hampered by its focus on multiple competing initiatives, which has undermined its effectiveness of its core economic priorities.\n\nA prime example of this is the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program, a key component of Bidenomics aimed at expanding high-speed internet access. Although almost $43 billion has been allocated to this initiative at the end of 2021 and the money was sent to the states last summer, as of today, no households have been connected due to administrative restrictions and delays, including efforts to regulate internet pricing. At the same time, the Affordable Connectivity Program, which provided subsidies to low-income households for internet access, increased broadband prices for all consumers by subsidizing demand without expanding supply because BEAD has ultimately failed. On average, ACP increased broadband prices by about seven percent.\n\nMoving forward, reducing the deficit and deregulation in a way that increases market competition would be more effective at reducing costs for essential goods like housing, food, and healthcare. Congress will have an opportunity to do this in the new year by dealing with a series of events, such as the expiration of the 2017 tax cuts and the reinstatement of the debt limit, as well as many other fiscal inflection points that, regardless of how the election turns out, you will be asked to confront. The budget process and budget reconciliation, in particular, are tailor made to provide an opportunity to address the rising cost of living by reducing government spending.\n\nWith that, I yield back the remainder of my time. I look forward to your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:56.896744Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T12:24:16.705431Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":787,"annotations":[{"id":277,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Z2k3DU3r19","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"K0yEo3Bwo1","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"sV0SLcUu9Z","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"yUpJvk_GLf","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"VcfsLCR-nQ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"67GQRsgSRf","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"L2FefUmUkI","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T12:24:20.568983Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T12:24:20.569009Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.453,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"b5175ce8-a329-456f-8fbe-91b7c992d696","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":787,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":8,"text":"Mr. Fallon Thank you very much.

My name is Patrice Onwuka, and I am the Director of the Center for Economic Opportunity at Independent Women's Forum. We are committed to increasing the number of women who value free markets and personal liberty. My remarks today will focus on how ill-advised Federal policies under the Biden-Harris Administration have led to remarkable hardship for American households.\n\nWe know that prices are up 20 percent, heating oil is up 36 percent, electricity is up 32 percent, natural gas up 25 percent. Housing costs have accelerated and are the biggest driver of the Consumer Price Index, also the inflation rate. Credit cards and mortgages all cost more each month. And consequently, American households are in a more tenuous financial position than they were before the inflation took off in early 2021. Lagging growth in real wages has eroded Americans' purchasing power. Average households have lost roughly $2,000 of purchasing power since that time. The average middle-class household lost at least $33,000 in real wealth. Personal savings have fallen by nearly $3 trillion, while collective credit card balances are an all-time high of $1.1 trillion. The monthly cost of the median-priced home in the United States is at its highest in more than 30 years.\n\nMore alarmingly, poor and working-class families are spending disproportionately more of their income on essential items such as food and energy. Low-income families often face a heat-or-eat dilemma, an existential choice between paying for utilities or buying food, medicine, and shelter. And low-income Black communities, households experienced the highest rates of energy challenges compared to their other demographic comports' households. Regionally, low-income families in the Southeast states are also disproportionately likely to face energy hardships. Take a 44-year-old North Carolina mom who said, `sometimes I have to choose between whether I am going to pay the light bill or pay rent and food.'\n\nWhy is that the case in the United States, in a place where we should have so much prosperity? Well, I would argue that Federal policy under the Biden Administration has undermined domestic energy production and fueled inflation. Inflation and high prices are the consequences of unsustainable Federal spending and burdensome regulations, particularly on energy. Economists on the left and the right agree that the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan fueled inflation by injecting the economy with stimulus funding when the economy could not keep pace.\n\nIt is a myth that inflation is due to Russia invading Ukraine. Inflation had already risen to 7.9 percent when Putin invaded Ukraine. It is also a myth that supply chain disruptions continue to drive inflation today. We have seen those supply chain disruptions have eased, and thankfully, the overly generous pandemic benefits that were a disincentive for people to return to work have come to an end. Finally, it is a myth that big companies, from energy companies to grocers, are price gouging, causing prices to remain high. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco examined industry-level data on price markups of goods and found no evidence of widespread markups on goods across all industries, so legislation and regulatory efforts to attack price gouging are futile at best and will not bring down prices.\n\nThe Biden-Harris climate agenda has focused on undermining domestic energy production, causing energy costs to rise. Everything grown, manufactured, produced, packaged, and transported depends on energy, and as energy prices rise, we as consumers are forced to pay more for the goods and services we depend on. Yet this Administration has canceled pipelines, taking millions of acres offline for drilling, and instituted restrictive new environmental standards that raise the cost of drilling. It has also pursued a carbon-reducing regulatory agenda that forces households to switch to costly appliances. We are paying 34 percent more for appliances compared to 15 years ago, and by targeting 15 consumer appliances with new energy restriction standards, everything from stoves to refrigerators and air conditioners, even clothing washers and dishwashers, we are going to see fewer available appliances on the market, fewer options for consumers.\n\nThe upfront cost of installing these new appliances are cost prohibitive to many households, so they are not even going to enjoy any purported energy savings, and they will have to compromise on features and performance and results. Let us be realistic here. How can we ask American households to pay an average of $9,000 to retrofit their home with these appliances when they can barely afford heat?\n\nI look forward to more discussion about today's topic, and thank you for your time."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:56.896889Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T13:44:36.800168Z","inner_id":9,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":789,"annotations":[{"id":279,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"DBC-oyf4YQ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"oDbiw2XIYl","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"sWBBmdNvF9","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"GDeKzuztT-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"7LIjQQq58q","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"kwmM5M_sYo","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"cOjCaGWcZR","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T13:44:40.941746Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T13:44:40.941772Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.819,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"9b9f657f-3ed4-4158-86c3-dd34e3834d87","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":789,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":10,"text":"Mr. Fallon Thank you very much.

I think it is important to note that as the COVID-19 triggered a recession, it was, in fact, a very short and sharp recession due to the fact that it was government-imposed lockdowns that caused the loss in labor. In the period of time from the recession to the inauguration of the Biden-Harris Administration, though, 57 percent of those pandemic jobs that were lost were recovered. It took another 17 months, though, to return to the same level of employment that had been the case just before the onset of COVID.\n\nNow, with all that Federal money being spent, the question might be why did it take 17 months? For gosh sakes, that is a long time. One reason is likely the collapse of what has been known as the multiplier effect. That is an economic theory that says that when the Federal Government spends money or ``invests in the economy,'' that those investments result in a multiple of dollars being returned back to the economy, as might happen with real investments. Unfortunately, as we have now accumulated some $35 trillion in Federal debt, the multiplier effect has been declining.\n\nDuring the Great Recession era of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--that would be clear back in 2009, almost halcyon times by comparison to today--the multiplier effect at that time for that government spending was estimated to be about 60 cents on the dollar. In other words, you were 40 cents underwater. The most recent expenditures, for example, with the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, the multiplier effect is likely collapsed to 20 cents on the dollar, meaning a lot of that money is being wasted, and as a result, the investments really function to change the economy. We saw that when President Biden, just a couple of weeks ago, admitted that the Inflation Reduction Act had little to do with reducing inflation and everything to do with transitioning the economy from hydrocarbons to electricity for the purposes of climate change.\n\nNow, I have got perhaps some advanced warning or experience with this because, like Mr. Khanna, I am originally from California. In fact, I served in the legislature there for 6 years before being termed out and then, I think wisely, moving to Texas in 2011. While I was a state legislator, I voted ``no'' a lot, and I voted ``no'' on the very items that, of course, passed the legislature back then and have been kind of mirrored in Federal policy since, so it is like a preview of coming attractions. And of course, this is somewhat due to, as we refer to the state sometimes as laboratories of democracy, and for better or for worse, California is often at the very leading edge of developing these new ideas, and we can kind of see from the record how that has affected Californians.\n\nSo, for example, the U.S. Census Bureau since 2009 has published the Supplemental Measure of Poverty. It takes into account the cost of living, noncash benefits, et cetera. California, ever since this new measure was rolled out, has always had the Nation's highest poverty rate. The other thing that I think is important to understand is the regulatory burden in California. We passed a measure back when I was in office--one of the things I did vote for--that looked at the regulatory compliance cost in California for California-based regulations. What we found is that in inflation-adjusted terms today, it would be worth more than $200,000 per small business simply to comply with regulations. It is important to note, then, though, that at the time, Federal regulations were estimated to be, oh, I do not know, at about $1.1 trillion in compliance costs, meaning that the Biden-Harris regulatory regime more than doubled the amount of regulations that were on the books just before the Great Recession.\n\nI think it is also important to understand that energy plays a big role in this. California has seen their energy costs go from 8th highest in the Nation to now the second highest in the Nation, only behind Hawaii, and there are reasons for this. It is California's aggressive push for electrifying their economy. It comes at a great cost to California workers and to the very high cost of living in California, and unfortunately, I think that we are going down the same path today.\n\nAnd then last, I think it is important to note that some people who look at the Biden-Harris record like to point to total payroll growth since the inauguration. The problem with that is that we are looking at total employment. We are not looking at how much average wages have grown. And if you know anything about how employment has shifted since inauguration, the vast majority of those jobs have gone to foreign-born individuals, many of whom probably all of whom--majority, pardon me--are here illegally. So, people who are benefiting from this are generally not Americans.\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:56.897033Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T13:47:24.539034Z","inner_id":11,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":791,"annotations":[{"id":281,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"5w7JdzpakK","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"BzedSuFOaq","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"wHlLrTWz-A","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Db9F07Vcif","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"JSitZSPmjc","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"RI0zrdfKKD","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"CZrR_kVE6h","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T13:47:28.343011Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T13:47:28.343037Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.488,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"52963cc6-2bcc-4e6e-abb7-5af2e77f5cc3","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":791,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":12,"text":"Mr. Fallon Thank you, sir.

My name is Brendan Duke, and I am Senior Director for Economic Policy at the Center for American Progress Action Fund. I am honored to testify today on the performance of the economy since 2021, as well as some of the inflationary risks I see on the horizon.\n\nInflation has been a challenge for working families since 2020, but the good news is that the 6-month annualized inflation rate was 2.3 percent in July, just above the Federal Reserve's target. It is now lower than the 3.1 percent rate when President Biden took office in January 2021. In fact, the Federal Reserve cut rates just last week because inflationary risks have receded. The U.S. economy has weathered an array of once-in-a-generation challenges or even once-a-generation challenges such as a pandemic, Russia's war in Ukraine, a semiconductor shortage, and more.\n\nThe recovery is most apparent in the share of workers with a job which is essentially at a peacetime high and at its 2000 level, after accounting for the aging of the population. The wage of a typical worker grew 25 percent between the 4th quarter of 2019 to July 2024, while prices rose 22 percent. Wage growth for lower-wage workers has been even faster.\n\nThere is no dispute that cumulative inflation over the last 4 years has frustrated families, though. An analysis of when, where, and why inflation surged shows that the vast majority of it is the result of supply chain disruptions that came from the unfreezing of the parts of the economy that froze during the pandemic. We have published analyses by the White House Council of Economic Advisers and former Federal Reserve Chair and Bush Administration official, Ben Bernanke, showing this. But perhaps the easiest way to see this is to look at inflation in other advanced economies, which also surged. The U.S.'s fiscal response to COVID was larger than these other countries, but they experienced similar inflation to us. I still have not heard a single explanation for how the U.S. could have avoided these inflationary shocks that hit Germany, the U.K., and other rich countries.\n\nWhere the U.S. economy does stand apart, though, is growth. The German economy, for example, grew less than one percent, and the U.K. economy grew less than two percent. Over a period, the U.S. economy grew over nine percent. If the supply chain disruptions caused the inflationary surge, it is worth spending some time on when exactly they arose. The 6-month inflation rate was already 2.6 percent in October 2020, well above the Federal Reserve's target. It exceeded three percent the month Biden took the oath of office and was almost four percent in March, the month Biden signed the American Rescue Plan. A look at more granular supply chain indicators, like the New York Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, and the number of ships waiting to dock outside the ports of L.A. and Long Beach similarly indicate that these disruptions preceded the Biden Administration.\n\nPolicymakers should celebrate the achievement of bringing down inflation back toward the Fed's two-percent target without a recession, essentially a soft landing, but unfortunately, some are trying to immediately reverse that progress of reducing inflation. Former President Trump has proposed a 10-to 20-percent tax on every imported good entering the country, and a 60-percent tax of every imported good from China. I have estimated that this could lead to a $3,900 tax increase for a typical family.\n\nMy analysis is in line with several other think tanks, including conservative ones like the Tax Foundation, $6,000; the American Action Forum, $3,900; and the National Taxpayers Union, $2,500. Wall Street analysts, including Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg Economics, the Capital Group, and Moody's, estimate that these import taxes would bring inflation back into the 3- to 4-percent range. In fact, the 20-percent import tax would raise gas prices by about 30 cents per gallon by taxing Canadian oil and gas imports.\n\nTrump has framed his proposal as a way to counter China's nonmarket practices, but 60 percent of the imports they would tax come from six U.S. allies and neighbors: Canada, Mexico, the EU, the U.K., Japan, and South Korea. The Biden Administration's strategy is different. It focuses trade remedy actions on precisely those goods where it is in the national interest to maintain industrial competitiveness, and then to align those actions with significant investment in American manufacturing. Moreover, it views tariffs as just one part of a larger reindustrialization strategy designed to rebuild the country's productive capacity and sustain American competitiveness well into the future.\n\nThe results of the Biden Administration's manufacturing strategy speak for themselves. It helped spur the creation of 700,000 new manufacturing jobs, pushing the total number of manufacturing jobs above pre-pandemic levels, which is especially impressive coming out of a recession. New factory construction has almost doubled after adjusting for inflation.\n\nThe American economy has weathered a pandemic, global supply shocks from geopolitical events, and more. Americans have come out ahead, and it looks like the economy is headed for a soft landing. Policymakers should seek to build on these successes instead of undermining them. With that, I yield back the balance of my time and thank you."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:56.897180Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T13:50:52.721911Z","inner_id":13,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":793,"annotations":[{"id":283,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"GbdbYtqM5-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"BRul8-Qapf","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"tZwe6wLK4u","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"huW4WNNL0c","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"x5cFAsWMsi","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"rrHvhPLt01","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"vT2MyO2Yfq","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T13:50:58.992617Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T13:50:58.992641Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":5.961,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"ec315d1e-56a2-4071-95a5-a2d10bccb62c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":793,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":14,"text":"Mr. Fallon Thank you very much for your testimony.

We saw the huge crash that happened in 2008 that devastated our economy, wiped out people's wealth, wiped out their savings, wiped out teachers who had their retirement accounts completely destroyed, people who lost their homes, who ended up homeless as a result of it.

OK Thank you. I appreciate that, but I do want to clarify that some of the statements that were made this morning about price gouging, and especially around the energy sector, are just unfactual. The American people know they are being price gouged. Go grocery shopping. We see it. We see it every day.\n\nIn terms of American energy, the facts do not support what was stated here. We have the highest oil and gas production in American history has happened over the last several years. The reason why gas is expensive at the pump is because these oil and gas companies are jacking up the price at the pump in order to make more money. They have record profits. That is what is going on. It has nothing to do with production, so we need to actually be clear.\n\nAnd then, Mr. DeVore, I appreciate that you are a former House Rep. I appreciate anyone who puts their name on the line, but the statement that was made about immigrants who are undocumented taking American jobs under the legislation that we passed is a statement that Donald Trump made at a rally and is just untrue. So, I just want to be clear about that. Second, the Inflation Reduction Act is the name that was assigned to a bill, that President Biden passed, by the U.S. Senate. That is a name that came from the U.S. Senate. So just wanted to do a little fact checking here this morning.

I think it is very interesting.\n\nBut anyway, Mr. Winfree, overregulation has been the silent killer of economic growth under the Biden-Harris Administration, imposing roughly $1.7 trillion in regulatory costs on businesses and households in the last 4 years. To rein in these egregious levels of red tape, we introduced the REG, the Budgeting Act, to establish a regulatory spending cap for each Federal agency, to incentivize agencies to reduce these burdens, and rescind outdated regulations before they institute new ones. This action alone could save hundreds of billions of dollars or more in unnecessary costs, as we saw during the Trump Administration, which achieved a net reduction in unnecessary regulatory costs.

Four years ago this week, there were over 750,000 new COVID cases. People were being hospitalized in tents and on ships because hospital buildings did not have the capacity to house the hundreds and thousands of patients. Four years ago today, this week, 20,000 people died from COVID-19, adding to the already half-a-million deaths in the U.S. alone. Now, this is because of the pandemic that people were dying, and they were dying alone, their bodies being stored in refrigerator trucks because morgues, mortuaries, and funeral homes could not house them.\n\nPeople were dying by the thousands, and Trump did what he always does. He lied. He tried to deceive the public by denying that the COVID-19 virus even existed. And after hundreds and thousands of people continued to die, he told them that it would be like the flu. It is going to be like the flu, and it will just go away. But when that did not happen, he started to then suggest that we ingest bleach to deal with the COVID-19 virus that was killing thousands of people, that shut down the world, closed people sheltering in place in their homes and closed businesses. That is what that Administration did when the pandemic struck in the United States and all over the globe.\n\nSo, when my colleagues on the other side of the aisle spend their time chasing baseless accusations and providing no solutions to the American people, I just get a little frustrated because Democrats, when we had the majority in the 117th Congress, we took decisive action, passing landmark bills like the American Rescue Plan that put shots in arms that helped people keep their businesses open, that really helped kept people from losing their homes and paying their bills; the Pact Act, which helped veterans who put their lives on the line so that people like me can enjoy the freedoms that far too many of us take for granted would get the benefits that they deserve. And it does not end there.\n\nThanks to the leadership of Speaker Pelosi, President Biden, and Vice President Harris, we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in our climate in human history. We passed the CHIPS and Science Act, investing tens of billions of dollars in technology, which has yielded more investment from private companies. That is helping to develop everything from chips to cars to computers, to all the things that we use every day that were on backlog because of the pandemic under the Trump Administration. We passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, the largest investment in our roads, railway, and bridges, where communities like mine have been struggling with disinvestment for decades.\n\nAnd because of big, bold policies like these, our economy is now the envy of the world. Inflation is coming down. Our unemployment rate is historically low. Even the stock market is at record highs. President Biden and Vice President Harris have brought 800,000 manufacturing jobs back to the American people. Thanks to the IRA, Medicare was able to negotiate prescription drug costs for the first time, lowering costs for our seniors and people with disabilities. And thanks to the CHIPS and Science Act, America is now on track to manufacture 30 percent of the world's semiconductor chips. Just a few years ago, under Trump, how many were we supplying? Zero.\n\nSo, Mr. Duke, can you tell us how would you characterize the state of the American economy right now?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:57.068574Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T14:20:10.953275Z","inner_id":90,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":870,"annotations":[{"id":360,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"AM122EZjZ3","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"7c_LGgVKy7","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"wNvWKPFQHw","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"K_-BdXzyGJ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"sfi2DGvZb-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"oadSbuEMP_","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"_c_yI9aV9L","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T14:20:37.984570Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T14:20:37.984604Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-05T14:20:35.408235Z","lead_time":26.688,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"ac22e5ee-9e95-44cb-8178-2a57dd893a4f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":870,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":91,"text":"Mr. Duke We went through the toughest thing an economy can go through, a body blow, and we have built back better in a lot of ways.

Yes If you look at history with California, you go back to, let us say, 1960, the cost of living relative to the rest of the country was about 105 to 110 percent, so, you know, roughly 5 to 10 percent higher as an index if the rest of the country averages out to a hundred. Today it is between 145 to 150, meaning it is about 45 percent more costly to live in California than in the average of the U.S. A huge part of that is a regulatory burden. I mentioned, for example, the cost of electricity. When I was in the legislature, we went from 8th most expensive in the country, and now California is No. 2, only behind Hawaii, which derives its electricity from diesel generators and a little bit of solar, and that is pretty fantastic when you think about it. This huge state with all these abundant natural resources now has the second most costly electricity prices in the Nation, and that is pretty important when you look at the push to electrify our economy, not just the transportation sector, but everything."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:57.069114Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T14:25:07.358877Z","inner_id":97,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":877,"annotations":[{"id":367,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"eF6w89PAOJ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"8LHJIBUSUo","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"hHP-l58ksa","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"ML134kgstJ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"7OP6LYsBMX","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"hQ1plzX0i-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"A4fT7J9Zi4","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T14:25:16.462235Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T14:25:16.462272Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":8.801,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"f7cbb694-1c81-4e44-a2cb-9d462558996e","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":877,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":98,"text":"Mr. Fry How will it affect the cost of living for Americans on a national level if we take the California model and apply it to Washington?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:57.069189Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T14:25:16.494147Z","inner_id":98,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":878,"annotations":[{"id":368,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"F7uo1w42qt","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Qpydp6PuVW","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"9U38gfDon4","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"tMohw2BASr","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"_zKwGgEgrC","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"J0liUxXVQq","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"dVDLdl4wKu","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T14:26:00.942113Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T14:26:00.942140Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-05T14:25:53.663536Z","lead_time":44.148,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"26380b53-b4d7-4c41-ae46-569c1ac98a1e","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":878,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":99,"text":"Mr. DeVore It is pretty staggering.

That was several times, by the way, what the Federal regulatory burden was at the time.\n\nNow, the Biden-Harris Administration put in regulatory policies just in the last 3 1\/2 years that more than equaled the entire Federal regulatory burden as it existed about 20 years ago.

Of course, you need to open up Federal lands again for exploration and for energy extraction. I do not know if it can be undone, but certainly the Keystone XL pipeline was something that would have been fantastic for North America. Fascinating to me, though, that the Administration OK'd the Nord Stream 2 pipeline at the same time it shut down a pipeline to bring reliable, affordable Canadian energy into America. So, those two things right off the bat.\n\nThe other thing I think, would be to rescind a lot of these unhelpful subsidies that were passed in the Inflation Reduction Act. What happens is that they are giving an incentive to unreliable, un-dispatchable power, and when you have power grids, as we have seen in California and as we have begun to see in Texas that over rely on wind and solar, what ends up happening is those power grids become unstable. You start to have planned blackouts or brownouts to manage your power supply. And last, you have to invest hugely in batteries to try to store the energy when it is being produced for when it is not available.\n\nThe problem with battery energy, though, is it does not provide spinning reserve. Spinning reserve only can happen with large masses that allow for your electrical grid to be maintained at 60 hertz. Batteries cannot do that. And so, what happens is when your grid gets under strain because of a natural event, like a snowstorm or a heat wave, or where it is not a windy day, your grid is going to be increasingly under threat to have rolling blackouts because batteries and wind and solar cannot cut it. They do not have the reliability of thermal power like nuclear, coal, and natural gas."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:57.069433Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T14:27:02.524115Z","inner_id":101,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":881,"annotations":[{"id":371,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"H2SgNsjCZo","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"FLkPgHmpGK","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"EQCorVQx1w","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"sXbbX2ymdK","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"9l-OvnSlBh","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"nTSBruteB7","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"_CCmB9ba_v","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T14:27:05.267588Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T14:27:05.267614Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.442,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"a4855322-8ea5-427f-b4da-7b5734a458fc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":881,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":102,"text":"Mr. Fry Thank you for that.

Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have heard a lot of what I will call fun facts this morning, which are things that are actually not fact at all, but statements that are intended to advance a political reality that just is not true. And I do want to clear up a couple of these fun facts again.\n\nThere was some talk this morning about the electric grid, its resilience, and the Inflation Reduction Act and how the IRA is going to destroy our grid. Well, I invite any of my colleagues who made similar comments today to meet with your hometown utilities because I have utilities come visit me every day who are eager to access these resources because our grid in many places is decades old. It needs modernization. It needs resilience backups. And part of why, unfortunately, in Texas, our neighbor state, there was such a catastrophic failure a few years ago is because the grid was not resilient, and that is what the IRA is all about.\n\nI also want to talk about the causes of inflation. There has been a lot of assertions here that are not founded in modern economics. The causes of inflation are very clearly tied to the economic disruptions that happened during the pandemic. We had supply chain issues. We had labor disruptions. There was war in Europe and the Middle East now. We have foreign actors that were engaged in price fixing, like OPEC. And we know that American oil and gas companies, which are currently under investigation, have also been engaging in these activities. And we have price gouging by American companies that have been taking advantage of these disruptions to our economy to try to extract more money out of our working families.\n\nSo, you know, my colleagues made some comments this morning about the boogeyman of Project 2025. I want to just say Project 2025 is a boogeyman. Read it. You will see the policies that are being espoused in that document are extreme. If you have not read it yet, I highly encourage you to do so. And the other boogeyman is the gentleman that hopes to take the ideas that have been put there by the former Trump Administration officials and others who helped contribute it, who says that he wants to be a dictator on day one. He has already told us this. These policies are extreme. They would undermine women's rights. They would undermine LGBTQ rights. They would regulate morality. They would undermine banking regulations. They would undermine basic protections for working families all across the country.\n\nSo, the reason why we are focused on this issue and its relevance to this Committee is that we have a gentleman here who is actually a chapter author of the bill. So, we are discussing the actual content of the ideas that were brought before the Committee, but also because we are here to talk about what is going on with the economy and what policies are going to advance the American people.\n\nI think it is very clear when you look at the data, and you talk to Americans, and we look at our own individual ways in which the last several years have improved just our general quality of life. The Biden-Harris Administration helped to save our economy from freefall with the American Recovery Plan. They put into place a vision that is rebuilding the American economy over the next several decades, that is building infrastructure all across this country, that is creating millions of jobs, that is making Made in America manufacturing back in America, that is securing our national security. And that is helping veterans, low-income families, tribal communities, people of color, families. It is an agenda that is lifting up Americans.\n\nSo, I appreciate the focus on these issues today. Kitchen table economics are important to all of us, and with that, I yield back. Thank you."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:57.078408Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T15:12:26.966962Z","inner_id":164,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":944,"annotations":[{"id":434,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"m-Ikv41jRc","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"4QDZJpP6Kd","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"YLcL3V4VYp","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"hcD6c0yN0i","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"UNNwMoAVaH","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"J-t5dBTfch","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"qv620Qoq7N","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T15:13:53.136310Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T15:13:53.136334Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-05T15:13:35.338352Z","lead_time":85.834,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"e3ed36cb-2e70-4be0-b5bd-bce70cfc70f9","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":944,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":165,"text":"Mr. Fallon Thank you. You know, going into this hearing, I do not think any American would be surprised that Republicans would say that the economy is not as good as it should be or could be and it is, in fact bad, where Democrats were going to come up to the dais and say how awesome things were and how great everything is, and there are rainbows and unicorns and leprechauns throwing out gold coins. But the fact of the matter is, you know, when you look at the Democrats, and they had a Majority in the first 2 years that I had served in Congress from 2021 to 2023, they had unified government. They are going to claim they did magnificent things through massive government spending because, as they will claim, it cures all ills. And then we have some things, you know, statistics and have to be wary of people that want to cook the books.\n\nFor instance, the Minority witness said that wages have increased by 27 percent and inflation has only gone up 20 percent, so what is problem, but the devil is in the details because he was talking about overall payroll. Because there are more people on the payroll, there are more people employed. The employment pool itself has expanded. He was not talking about per capita, very, very important distinction.\n\nAnd then we have some of our friends on the other side of the aisle blame President Trump, because, you know, when COVID hit America in 2020, all the deaths were his fault because he wanted people to swallow bleach, which is another one of those lies. And then they said, ``because we put shots in people's arms,'' was the quote. Well, who is responsible for Operation Warp Speed? It was President Donald Trump. He was the one that said we are going to get this vaccine and we are going to essentially warp speed it. And he was mocked. He was ridiculed--``you cannot possibly get a vaccine that works that quickly''--and yet they did. And in 2020, undeniable fact, unfortunately, we lost 350,831 Americans to COVID. In 2022, we lost over 460,000 Americans to COVID. More people died of COVID in 2021 under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but the right does not blame them for the deaths because it was the virus that killed those people, so it was propaganda and more drivel.\n\nAnd any economic struggle under the Biden-Harris Administration is due to COVID. Even in 2024, they are still saying we are recovering from it. But any dark clouds that President Trump had in 2020, they just have amnesia about COVID at all and certainly want to forget, as I mentioned earlier, how well the economy was doing in the first 3 years of the Trump Administration. The debt-to-GDP ratio was significantly lower. Unemployment was at all-time lows across every demographic you can mention, and inflation was only at 1.8 percent.\n\nNow here is another important distinction because these are pesky facts. According to the Census Bureau, not fun fact, yes, real median income household income in 2019 was $68,703. Inflation went up 21.8 percent from that point to today, 2023 rather. In 2023, that would have meant that if real household median income kept pace with inflation, that would be $83,543. But in point of fact, it is now $80,610, which is $2,933 less than it should be, almost 4 percent less in real wages. That is just an inconvenient truth that our friends on the other side of the aisle don't want to discuss. That is $3,000 less, and to a family household, that is a big deal.\n\nSo, this is a question that I really would encourage every American to ask themselves, are you better off now than you were 4 years ago? When you look at the economy, if you just look at economics and you ask the American people, who can handle the economy better: Kamala Harris, a person that has never signed the front of one paycheck; or a successful businessman, Donald Trump. According to The New York Times, a recent poll, Trump wins that argument 54 to 41, CNBC 40 to 21 and NBC 50 to 41. Now, these are not, by any measure, conservative outlets. So, if you have just that issue, President Trump would win in a landslide.\n\nThat is why you hear our friends across the aisle talking about everything else but the economy when they are out on the campaign trail--abortion, Project 2025, the Russia hoax--and then they will misquote, as Kamala Harris did in the debate, saying he said that if he does not win, there is going to be a bloodbath. He was referring to the auto industry and how they would have an economic bloodbath. That is just intellectually dishonest, and if the right did that, I would be upset as well because that is taking things completely out of context.\n\nAnd then we heard it twice up here about bleach. ``You wanted people to swallow bleach.'' I think every 6-year-old knows, you swallow bleach, it is not going to be a good outcome. Again, twisting words. `Dictator on day one'--all that kind of stuff. And that is why they do not want you to talk and think about the kitchen table economics, because it does not bode well for them. It will be a landslide if this election is decided on that front. You talk about California and Texas, our two biggest states----"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-05T11:24:57.078506Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T15:13:53.169486Z","inner_id":165,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":945,"annotations":[{"id":435,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"gc09vHucxI","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"2y156Krdf7","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"_AIAHVoJ9e","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"pRJd_1vo4O","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"gqblskLSVS","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"ONTVufOHKg","from_name":"stance-on-topic-6","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"WLT1mHN7Wl","from_name":"stance-on-topic-7","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-05T15:14:02.301340Z","updated_at":"2025-06-05T15:14:02.301365Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":8.798,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"00a5ebba-19aa-499f-a12e-16d8ab6b427a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":945,"project":11,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"23203361-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":166,"text":"Ms. Stansbury.
