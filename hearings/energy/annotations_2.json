            "text": "Chairman Comer The Committee on Oversight and Accountability will come to order.\n\nI want to welcome everyone.\n\nWithout objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time.\n\nI now recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement.\n\nMadam Secretary, I want to thank you for being here today before the Committee. We are glad that you have returned safely after traveling to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates last week.\n\nI am sure you were well-received abroad, but I hope the purpose of your trip was not to urge these foreign nations to boost their output of fossil fuels, especially while President Biden and his Administration, including you as Secretary of the Department of Energy, have taken several actions to make the United States less energy independent, including by trying to shut down American fossil fuel production.\n\nPresident Biden and the Secretary should not be prioritizing foreign energy over American energy when we have the natural resources and producers to be energy independent. Unfortunately, the Biden Administration has pursued policies that have jeopardized economic opportunities, threatened U.S. energy security and national security, raised energy costs on Americans, and hurt American small businesses.\n\nToday marks the Committee's 15th hearing at the full and subcommittee level during the 118th Congress, specifically related to the Biden Administration's American energy policies and burdensome regulations. Our oversight hearings have examined a range of topics, including energy efficiency standards, critical minerals, nuclear energy, and the Administration's ban on liquified natural gas export permits to non-free trade agreement countries.\n\nDecisions like the Department's ban on new liquified natural gas export permits are just the most recent example of how the Department has jeopardized our energy security, jobs, and producers.\n\nAccording to the Center for LNG, increasing LNG exports provides great economic benefits, like bolstering labor incomes and lowering the cost of imported goods, thereby protecting consumers from inflation. Further, we know that increased U.S. LNG sent to Europe will safeguard the continent from reliance on Russian gas.\n\nRather than ask questions about the consequences of the LNG ban or other Administration policies, however, today, we will likely hear Committee Democrats demonize U.S. oil and gas producers.\n\nWhile Democrats politicize energy and target American producers, average national gasoline prices surged on President Biden's watch to an all-time high, with an average national price of gas reaching more than $5 a gallon in the summer of 2022. congressional Republicans share a different vision for America's energy future. On March 30, 2023, the Republican Majority House passed H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, which would reform the permitting process, lower process for consumers, and help restore U.S. energy leadership for the world. And today, the Committee has released a report detailing the harms the Biden Administration policies have inflicted on American consumers and the U.S. economy, which I will enter into the record with unanimous consent.\n\nWithout objection, so ordered.\n\nIt is undeniable that gas prices are higher under the Biden Administration, with gas prices surging to over $5 nationally in 2022 as a result of Biden Administration policies.\n\nAnd as the Biden Administration rapidly overloads our grid with its electrification-at-all-costs push, American consumers face skyrocketing electricity prices. Electricity prices have risen faster than the pace of inflation and more so than any other commodity.\n\nOur Committee's work in the 118th Congress has ranged from the Department's LNG ban, elimination of consumer choices for home appliances, historic depletion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and, of course, the waste of taxpayer dollars on the Secretary's now famous and disastrous 4-day summer 2023 electric vehicle road trip.\n\nThis work has expanded to include the Committee's governmentwide investigation into the Chinese Communist Party's ongoing efforts to target, influence, and undermine every sector and community in the United States, including the energy sector.\n\nBut the Biden Administration's rhetoric on climate change and adoption of radical Green New Deal policies, specifically its electronic vehicle mandates, play directly into China's hands.\n\nCommittee Republicans will continue to conduct oversight of government waste, fraud, and abuse. We will not stand by silently as the Biden Administration subverts America's energy independence and demonizes this critical industry.\n\nI now yield to the Ranking Member for his opening remarks."

            "text": "Mr. Raskin. Mr Chairman, thank you.\n\nThank you, Secretary Granholm, for joining us today. And I also hope that you are not traveling around the world promoting more fossil fuel combustion and use.\n\nMy colleagues had invited you here today to testify about President Biden's so-called war on energy, which we know does not exist. For better or worse, the United States is producing record high levels of oil and natural gas today. It has never been so high, so our colleagues can breathe easy if that is their principal interest.\n\nAt the same time, President Biden and the Department of Energy, in partnership with Democrats in Congress, are making historic and necessary investments in clean energy technology. Climate change is the defining crisis of our time, and we know that burning fossil fuels is, by far, the leading factor in contributing to climate change, a fact that fossil fuel companies knew about decades ago but suppressed.\n\nOur recent joint staff report with the Senate Budget Committee showed the evolution of Big Oil's efforts to deceive the American public, from outright denial of the facts that they understood in the 1960s and 1970s, and then more up-to- date subtle propaganda and disinformation efforts today to try to lead us away from the solutions that we need.\n\nBecause of this deception, we have lost crucial decades in which we could have been systematically transitioning away from dirty, polluting fossil fuels to the cleaner alternative energies we need. Now we are forced to take much more dramatic actions to transition to clean energy as quickly as possible.\n\nWith every passing day, the consequences of climate change grow in intensity. In just the last week, we have learned, not only are the sea levels rising, not only are we seeing record forest fires, record drought, record flooding in different parts of the country, hurricanes of record velocity, but there is even greater disruption taking place to people's daily lives. There are swarms of mosquitoes in Harris County, Texas, in unprecedented numbers and sizes. The oceans are actually changing colors. We are in a very rapid downward descent because of climate change.\n\nResearchers have found that the economic damage caused by climate change is six times worse than was previously predicted. A new paper estimates that just 1 degree Celsius of warming would cause the world's GDP to decline by 12 percent. We already hit more than 1 degree Celsius of warming since preindustrial times and are currently on track to hit 3 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century.\n\nWe must break free from the carbon trap, which will require significant effort and investment into the clean energy transition. The Department of Energy, I believe, is doing that, thanks to funding from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Because of these historic investments the American people have made, the U.S. is on track by 2030 to double the amount of clean energy we generate and to cut emissions by 40 to 50 percent compared to 2005 levels.\n\nThe Administration's focus on clean energy has also spurred over $400 billion of new investments in clean energy by private companies, about half of which is specifically being invested in manufacturing today. The U.S. economy has added 800,000 manufacturing jobs since the start of this Administration, and the Inflation Reduction Act is anticipated to create more than 1.5 million jobs over the next decade. We have not had an unemployment rate this low in more than 50 years, and the clean energy economy plays a very important role in this economic renaissance.\n\nUnlike my colleagues across the aisle who want to promote falsehoods about this imaginary war on energy, Democrats recognize that the transition to clean energy is not just good for our climate and good for our planet, but also good for our economy and good for our communities. Every single one of our districts is profiting right now from the benefits of projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure legislation.\n\nIn fact, a company in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, in the good Chairman's district, is receiving $480 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for sustainable battery manufacturing. Another company in Calvert City, Kentucky, also in the Chairman's district, which I use by way of illustration, is receiving up to $35 million in Federal cost share under the Inflation Reduction Act to electrify and decarbonize its heating process.\n\nThis is taking place all over America today. This is happening now. These types of investments are significant and historic. They are exactly what we need to move away from the dangerous dependence on fossil fuels. And that is not a question of moral guilt. The whole society is implicated in it, but we have got to save ourselves from the implications of it.\n\nI commend the work of the Biden-Harris Administration. I commend you, Madam Secretary, for everything you have been doing to ensure the United States is able to transition effectively away from dirty energy to clean energy while also making sure that our economy is strong.\n\nThank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back."

            "text": "Secretary Granholm. Great Thank you so much.\n\nChairman Comer, Ranking Member Raskin, and Members of the Committee, I am so proud to be here representing more than 100,000 talented, hardworking public servants who make up the Department of Energy.\n\nThree years ago, I joined this Administration, believing that if America could come together around a national energy strategy, we could restore American manufacturing, we could create jobs, we could address the climate crisis and become energy independent and secure.\n\nAnd today, we are doing just that. America is back. Thanks to Congress' efforts and the President's vision, we are executing a focused, deliberate strategy that positions our businesses to dominate, our workers to compete, and our communities to thrive. And it is working. We are rebuilding our manufacturing backbone.\n\nSince the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, for example, companies have announced more than 600 new or expanded plants on American soil just for clean energy, hundreds of billions in planned investment, for batteries, for electric vehicles, solar, wind, nuclear and more; tens of thousands of jobs being created from the industrial Midwest to the industrious mid-Atlantic to the Southern battery belt to the Southwest sunbelt to the West Coast to the Gulf Coast.\n\nBy re-shoring and on-shoring manufacturing supply chains, we are also catching up to our global competitors. For example, right now, China possesses 65 percent of the world's lithium and 100 percent of its graphite, which are critical for 21st century technologies. But because of the President's investments, U.S. graphite production is expected to increase 25 fold by 2030. Lithium production is expected to increase 85 fold. And through it all, we have spurred a nationwide effort to modernize America's energy system, which will bring more clean power to more families at lower cost. For example, we are supporting the build-out of more than 600 miles of new transmission lines.\n\nThis strategy to strengthen America's energy security, to protect American jobs, and to save American families money is guiding our work across the Department. It is behind our successful usage of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves.\n\nOur sales in the summer of 2022, kept Russia's weaponization of energy markets from hurting our consumers at the pump. And now, our replenishment strategy has almost finished restoring those supplies at a bargain for the taxpayer.\n\nThe strategy has also guided our energy efficiency rulemaking process. For example, last month, DOE finalized energy conservation standards for domestic power transformers that will increase their efficiency and competitiveness, while saving American steel jobs.\n\nIn short, Congress and the President have crafted a historic strategy to invest in America, and DOE is proud to help implement it. We recognize that we have been entrusted with unprecedented resources to do so, and that is why at every step of the way, we are taking extra measures to protect the American taxpayer's investment, to meet the goals set forth by Congress, and to avoid potential for waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\nWe have set up new processes for our offices to coordinate on program designs so that we are eliminating redundancies, leveraging expertise across the Department, and learning from past experiences.\n\nFrom day one, we have prioritized hiring specialists in project and program oversight, in grant management, in contracting, financial and audit oversight. And we regularly and proactively seek guidance from DOE's Office of Inspector General on how to best protect the integrity of our investments.\n\nOur continued cooperation will be essential for keeping this momentum and building a stronger and safer future for the American people.\n\nI look forward to your questions. Thank you."

And, in addition to that, we have authorized another 22 that are under construction, 22 billion that are currently under construction.\n\nThe bottom line is so much has happened in terms of exports of liquified natural gas since the last assessment was done, we have exploded our authorizations.\n\nSo, this pause only applies to new ones coming down the pike. Everybody who is exporting now, everybody who is under construction, everybody who is authorized who does not have a final investment decision, all can proceed.\n\nWe are the biggest exporter. We will continue to be exporting. And it will not affect the jobs. It will not affect what is happening already in terms of exports."

And this was designed as an opportunity that Congress gave the Secretary authority and money to innovate for ultra- efficient vehicles.\n\nAnd yet it should contain, based upon the scenarios and the ratios, almost anybody that would qualify, based upon their ratio of making cleaner energy. And yet I see where over and over your department is going on the side of EV as opposed to other ideas.\n\nYet we know that electronic vehicles--just ask Avis and Hertz--they cannot even get rid of them. The diminishing value, the loss of jobs, the amount of problems that come with these. And yet I see your department giving money, loans, entirely to EV projects as opposed to others that may qualify also.\n\nCould you please talk about that? You got a minute, 47 seconds, ma'am."

And we are all about the carrots at the Department of Energy.\n\nSo, the grants from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act have created an environment where America has become the irresistible Nation for investment in clean energy. We are the envy of other nations for having been so forward-leaning on creating jobs here. So, it is a very exciting time for both responsiveness to addressing climate change but also creating jobs in America."

And that is really what we see happening, and that's the anticipation. That is why some states talk about rolling brownouts that are coming their way. They are very concerned about that, as am I.\n\nLet us talk for just a second about electric vehicles, if we can. So, the funding came in the IRA, and the Federal budget estimated--let me get this right here.\n\nIn the 117th Congress, we passed the IRA. My Democrat colleagues did, anyway. And they provided--CBO and JCT estimated that the eliminate spending and tax breaks would cost around $400 billion by moving to electric vehicles, commercial electric vehicles, heavy duty electric vehicles, tax credit for residential charging equipment, and $3 billion for postal fleet electrification. They estimated that would have a net of $400 billion cost.\n\nSince that bill has passed, now for those same programs, the estimate is that the subsidies will be $1.1 trillion over the same period of time.\n\nNow, of that, $7.5 million was generated for a nationwide electric vehicle charging infrastructure. And yet it has been reported that we now have four charging stations, I believe it is, and that was reported by NBC.\n\nDoes that sound accurate to you?"

So, I appreciate the work you are doing on that.\n\nReally interested in re-shoring some of the energy supply chain back to the United States. There is a grant that we put in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that allows battery material. So, EV batteries, all the components that go into that, we want to bring that home.\n\nSo, right now, there is one U.S. company that is competing for that grant. They are headquartered in my district, the Cabot Corporation, but they do all their manufacturing in Texas and in Michigan. So that is where the jobs would be created.\n\nBut they do great work. They are the only U.S. company bidding for this. And I just want to, you know, put a stake in the ground, put a flag in the ground on that for you to take a good hard look at that.

So, I am just flagging that for you if you could look at that.\n\nThird, so, we--myself, Mr. Connolly, and some others, Mr. Raskin--put in $3 billion for the post office to electrify their fleet. The post office has something like 237,000 vehicles. It is the second largest--after Department of Defense, they are the second largest owner of vehicles in the United States. We put $3 billion to help them convert to electric vehicles.\n\nI talked to Postmaster General DeJoy. He is doing it as fast as he can, but, you know, they are doing what the resources that we gave them. And we need to do this faster.\n\nWhen you think about--this is a wonderful opportunity for us to accelerate and amplify the use of electric vehicles. Think about the pattern in which the post office uses their vehicles. They charge them overnight. They use them in the morning. They deliver during the day, and then they come back and charge overnight. Those charging stations, if we had charging stations at every post office that were available to the public completely during the day--and post offices are everywhere, everywhere.\n\nSo, there is an opportunity here, but we have got to deploy the charging stations. They are close to everybody's homes. We have, you know, general mail facilities that could house hundreds of these charging stations. We could use them for our postal fleet overnight when nobody is using them, and then we could offer them to the public, perhaps, during the day. And it would--I just think it would give a real boost to the use of EVs, the ease of which needs to be enhanced.\n\nYour thoughts on that."

The goal is to get to 500,000 by 2030. And the private sector has stepped up a lot, but that is why the states are looking to fill in the gaps where charging stations do not exist. Every 50 miles along transportation corridors, for example."

So, it is a combination with us and all Massachusetts and all the other New England states. It would allow us to repurpose Brayton Point and one of the other power plants in our area in southeastern Massachusetts and connect them to the wind turbines that we have got going offshore.\n\nSo, it is a joint program. We have got facilities in southern Connecticut, Maine, northern Maine. And that is really, really, really important to us if we are going to convert--you know, that is a heavily populated area, New England, and we have got to upgrade our grid.\n\nSo, that is the Power Up New England program that Eversource and others are pushing.

PJM analysis showed that the deactivation of the Brandon Shores unit would cause severe voltage drop and thermal violations across seven PJM zones, which would lead to widespread reliability risk in Baltimore and the immediate surrounding area.''\n\nSo, let me make that plain for everybody. Brandon Shores, owned by Talen Energy, has entered into an agreement with the Sierra Club to not produce power, to not produce power. And so, the PJM, which operates in multiple states and schedules the power from various facilities, is asking that that agreement be held in abeyance until a reliable source can be built. But they are not going to do that.\n\nThe only thing that is going to save Baltimore from blacking out, from going without power, right, is an emergency designation from the Secretary and the Department of Energy. There is not enough time. Even if we wanted to build it--and we do not.\n\nAnd let me be clear here. The alternative is that Pennsylvania, where I live, provides the power, and our land is taken by eminent domain to send the power to Baltimore, who has a perfectly functioning power plant right now in Anne Arundel County, but because of the agreement, they are going to shut it down.\n\nSo, my two questions to start with for this are, is the Department of Energy in support of these type of agreements between the Sierra Club--like this--between the Sierra Club and Talen Energy to shut down plants, No. 1?\n\nAnd, No. 2, are you committed to the emergency declaration that is going to be required when the plant shuts down for over a million customers to have power and live in the 21st century?"

This is coming.\n\nAnd so, assuming--let us just do it this way. I do not want to assume on your behalf. But assuming this is valid--you can see the logo up there. I will have it entered into the record. I will stake my reputation on what the PJM has offered.\n\nAssuming that is correct, are you willing to commit to an emergency declaration so that the lights and the power can stay on for a million customers? It is going to require the Department of Energy."

I appreciate that, Madam Secretary.\n\nIn the little bit of time I have left, as Representative Biggs talked about, the loss of money to the car companies. Ford is delaying introduction of its all-new electric SUV. It lost $130,000 on every EV. The division will lose $5.5 billion in 2024. Tesla saw an 8.5 percent decline in deliveries. GM lost $1.7 billion in Q4 of 2023.\n\nThis is all happening at taxpayer expense. The increase in EV usage and sales is wholly by the Federal Government, right? It is not because of the private sector. Private sector is actually declining.\n\nAnd so, with that, while you are here, as a current Cabinet Secretary, would you commit to saying on the record that you will not support a bailout of the car companies once we bankrupt them, once these policies bank--because that is where we are headed, ma'am. We have already done this before. It cost us $81 billion in 2014.\n\nWhat will you commit to today regarding the car companies that are going to go bankrupt based on these requirements from the Federal Government?"

And thank you so much for speaking with me at length when you were in the St. Louis area the last time about these issues.\n\nSt. Louis and I are here today to discuss the climate crisis, of course, and the need for clean energy, as well as the devastating impact of nuclear waste created and completely abandoned by the Federal Government that continues to devastate my community to this day. And we know you were not in the seat at the time. I just want to say that.\n\nSecretary, as you know, Black and Brown communities are on the front lines of the climate crisis, and we have been the most impacted by the failure of the government to clean up toxic waste. And also, it is essential that, while we prioritize the transition to clean energy, we also address the legacy of the pollution in our communities.\n\nWorld War II is still killing people in my district. For over 80 years, we have been grappling with the nuclear contamination left over from the Manhattan Project, particularly in Coldwater Creek, which is a main waterway central to our community, as well as West Lake Landfill.\n\nIn March of this year, the Senate passed legislation that would reauthorize the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or better known as RECA, which provides health screenings and compensation for people sickened by the U.S. testing of nuclear weapons, as well as expanded to include St. Louis and other areas that have been historically excluded.\n\nBut now we are running out of time in the House. RECA is currently set to expire on June 7. We only have four legislative days left.\n\nSecretary Granholm, do you support the reauthorization of RECA?"

We are in the middle of a site-based process, a community-based siting process for nuclear waste.\n\nCurrently, as you are aware, civil nuclear waste is largely stored around those plants, which is safe, but it would be very helpful to the United States to have a national repository of nuclear waste that is safe.\n\nWe are in the process of this consent-based siting effort. There has been 12 entities that have been funded to reach out to communities who are potentially going to raise their hand and to decide how to compensate those communities for doing that service for our Nation.\n\nThat process is in the middle. It will take--it takes a bit of time. We are modeling it after a couple of other nations that did the same thing. It takes a bit of time to ensure that we get it right. But we are in the process of doing that, and we hope that will come out with a community or communities that are willing to do that."

I am glad we had a chance to hear about, a couple of weeks ago, the Biden-Harris Administration's historic efforts to invest in diverse and disadvantaged communities as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS and Science Act, which I was proud to help pass these bills into law under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi and President Biden, which are already making a difference in the communities across the country, including my district.\n\nLast year, the East Cleveland City School District received $100,000 under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to make critical energy upgrades to lower energy use and costs, improve indoor air quality, and promote healthier learning environments. I would like to thank you firsthand for that investment in Ohio's 11th congressional District.\n\nNow, Secretary Granholm, can you share with us the size and scale of the investments the Biden-Harris Administration has been implementing since these laws were passed and, specifically, how they have brought investment and opportunity to disadvantaged low-income and marginalized communities?"

If Congress has anything to consider into the future, we need to provide more school districts and disadvantaged communities the ability to upgrade their schools because it was so successful. The Department of Energy, under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, is responsible for about $98 billion worth of funds to be able to make our Nation more energy independent and more--and have our energy run cleaner.\n\nWe have, as a result, given out grants, and they have taken advantage of tax credits, too, to companies that are producing the products to get us there. As we give out grants, we want to make sure that all communities benefit. So, we require, for any business that is seeking a grant, to do a community benefits agreement, so that shows how they are employing the local community, how they are benefiting the local community, and it is an agreement. So, we are monitoring, and we are enforcing those agreements.\n\nAnd as a result, we are seeing that double the amount of job creation and benefits are going to disadvantaged communities than the rest of the population relative to size. So, we are excited about that, and we are excited about--thank you--the incentives that have been built into the tax credits to locate in disadvantaged communities, because that, too, is causing great--you know, much more investment in communities that might not have seen it otherwise."

These stations must be constructed, distributed, and built equitably, prioritizing low-income and underserved communities. Since nearly every major auto manufacturer, from GM to Ford to Jeep, has plans to expand and convert to fully electric fleets within the next decade, along with other vehicles, like school buses and postal vans, we cannot leave these communities behind with this vital aspect of energy security and access to transportation.\n\nSo, Secretary Granholm, can you speak to how the Biden- Harris Administration is supporting construction of charging stations for marginalized communities?"

The $7.5 billion that Congress approved under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for charging includes a significant component to go to communities that do not have access to charging right now, particularly in cities, particularly poor communities, particularly rural communities, places where the private sector has not yet built out charging stations.\n\nAnd so, the challenge for all of that--so, for example, if it is in a dense, urban environment, where do you put the chargers, what if people do not have garages or access to a garage, what if they are in an apartment building? All of those questions, as a business model, we are trying to figure out how to incentivize access to charging stations in an easy way.\n\nOf course, putting them in parking lots that are available to the public is one thing, but along street parking, can you create chargers that you pull down from the street lamps, for example? Are there other ways, creative ways to use technology to be able to give people access to charging?\n\nSo, the bottom line is, we want charging to be ubiquitous, we want it to be accessible by everybody."

Do you think recycling spent rods is actually in the Nation's interest?"

I want to followup with you on that because we should be using all that stuff at our disposal.\n\nI am glad that my colleague from Tennessee, Mr. Burchett, spent time with you talking about modular reactors and micro reactors, so I am not going to go down that line. I think it is important for the American people to understand that the future of baseload power in the United States, everything from AI Quantum, digital assets, to our current needs from an energy apparatus, we are going to need massive amounts of baseload power.\n\nAnd wouldn't you agree that solar panels and wind turbines are not going to be able to fulfill that need?"

            "text": "Mr. Casar Thank you, Chairman. Madam Secretary, I first want to thank you for your strong leadership at the Department of Energy.\n\nToday, I want to talk a little bit with you about the broken and disconnected Texas grid, ERCOT, not just on behalf of Texans, but also because of the national implications of not fixing the Texas grid.\n\nI want to start off by thanking you and the Department of Energy for putting millions of dollars toward electric reliability in Texas, including a recent $30 million investment to help keep the lights on in San Antonio, Texas, but we still have a long way to go.\n\nWe have had so many mass power outages--in fact, hundreds of mass power outages--over the last few years in Texas, making us one of the most unreliable electric grids in the country. And most people remember and think about this as it relates to Winter Storm Uri where over 10 million Texans lost power, hundreds of people died.\n\nAnd in the wake of that storm, you, Madam Secretary, said many things I agree with. You said that interconnecting Texas' grid will be great for Texas. It will be great for Texas to consider connecting to its neighbors.\n\nYou said that interconnecting Texas could also benefit the rest of the country because in good times, Texas is generating all sorts of clean energy, which we could send those clean ions out from Texas to take advantage of a market that is eager to accept it and could not agree more.\n\nThat is why I introduced the Connect the Grid Act, which would require Texas to interconnect with its neighbors. My office worked with your Department to draft this legislation, and we relied heavily on your excellent transmission needs study, which pinpoints our Nation's most significant transmission needs and identifies national interest electric transmission corridors known as NIETCs.\n\nJust last week, the Department of Energy announced its preliminary list of NIETCs, a designation that is really important because it unlocks Federal financing for transmission, but Texas was missing from your list. And that was confusing to me because you and I agree that interconnecting Texas provides reliability, could save American lives, save tons of money, is an economic winner, and we cannot reach our climate goals without interconnecting the grid.\n\nThat is, in part, because Texas leads the country in wind generation. We are only second to California in solar generation. An upcoming MIT study finds that between 9 gigawatts and 36 gigawatts of interconnection between Texas and its neighbors could get us a 4 percent CO2 reduction nationwide and a 33 percent CO2 reduction in the state of Texas.\n\nSo, in the next few weeks, I want to send a letter to your Department urging you to do everything you can to interconnect the Texas grid, whether that is through funding transmission or through transmission planning and more. And I am interested in hearing from you, Madam Secretary, if you are considering adding Texas to your final list of NIETC designations, where does Texas fit into your transmission planning?"

But you are right, it does not connect to ERCOT. And I stand by saying, of course, this is Texas' call, and so respect state sovereignty on this.\n\nBut I do think that when you consider the ability for a neighboring state to help in a time of crisis--and there is more and more of these extreme weather events that are happening and stressing grids--I think the Nation would love that. And, similarly, for those developers who are in Texas and who want to take advantage of the economy of clean energy to be able to export that power, I think, would be good for Texas, too.\n\nBut that is just me. I am just the Secretary of Energy. I am not in Texas, and I am not running Texas.\n\nSo, I look forward to working with you to see how we might be able to get there, but I do think it would be important to create a national grid that would include Texas at some point."

We, obviously, thanks to Congress, have this grid resilience innovation program which we are funding to make sure that all states have the ability to access clean power and upgrade their grids.\n\nWe are really interested as well in funding things like advanced grid technologies, grid-enhancing technologies, like advanced conductoring, dynamic line rating, et cetera, which would make it more efficient for energy to be transmitted across grids.\n\nIn the connectivity part, though, I would hope that in the next round of NIETCs, we could have this conversation about, actually, a firm connection to Texas. But, again, we do respect how the state views this and, you know, perhaps things will have changed at that point."

The planet is burning. It is on fire. And the Department of Energy is essential to mitigating its harms while ensuring a healthy environment with clean air for all. Policymakers at all levels of government have a responsibility to do everything we can to transition from dirty fossil fuels. That is why I was really pleased to partner with the city of Cambridge, in my district, the Massachusetts 7th, to deliver $1 million in Federal funding to create publicly available and community accessible electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nMadam Secretary, while some of my colleagues across the aisle have spread disinformation about EVs, as co-founder and co-chair of the Future of Transportation Caucus, I would like to set the record straight. Investing in electric vehicles is good for the environment. It is good for people's pocketbooks. It is good for public health, and it is good for job creation.\n\nSecretary Granholm, regarding that last piece in particular, can you speak to how the Office of Energy Jobs is helping folks take advantage of opportunities from the proliferation of electric vehicles?"

Yes We are seeing, as you have noted, all of these job sites opening up factories to create batteries for electric vehicles, or electric vehicles, or assembling the batteries into the vehicles. And it is a new thing.\n\nAnd so, the question is, how do you create a workforce that is capable of taking on this whole new sector of the economy. So, the Office of Energy Jobs has been working with our friends in labor to be able to create--and with our community colleges, to be able to create a workforce curriculum, for example, for batteries for electric vehicles that can be adopted in any part of the Nation, but can have certified workers to be able to do that.\n\nEvery time you have a new factory open up, there is an opportunity for an economic cluster and that cluster has to include the workforce component of it, and that is what the energy jobs office is doing."

Earlier this year the Department of Energy announced a multimillion-dollar center of excellence to accelerate the domestic wind energy industry-based in Massachusetts, ARROW, which stands for Academic Center for Reliability and Resilience of Offshore Wind, is led by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with partners from across the Nation from Northeastern University in my district to Morgan State, an HBCU in Maryland, to the University of Puerto Rico.\n\nARROW will help propel us toward a 100 percent clean electricity grid, a goal outlined in the Green New Deal, and a key part of the Biden-Harris Administration's climate agenda. Excited to see this work take off because there are significant benefits in harnessing wind as a renewable energy source, and one of those benefits is jobs, well-paid, union-backed jobs.\n\nSecretary Granholm, how can Congress help support workforce development in the domestic offshore wind energy industry to fill those roles from manufacturers to electricians and beyond?"

That is 3 months before the war began. So, I think you need to reevaluate your answer.\n\nBy the way, the price of a gallon of gas in December 2020 was $2.28. December 1921 it was $3.41. That is according to the Energy Information Administration. December 1922 it was $3.32. So, the Administration sold 50 million barrels, plus the additional barrels they sold later, as you say, because of the war in Ukraine, to affect gasoline prices by nine cents.\n\nAnd, by the way, according to EIA, the price of a gallon of regular gasoline right now is $3.73, $1.45 a gallon higher than it was in December 2020.\n\nYou made a comment while you were in Paris that China's dominance in the world's critical mineral supply chain is one of the pieces of the supply chain that we are very concerned about in the United States.\n\nDo you stand by that?"

Because I think it is interesting that decisions are being made to bring companies in that have direct ties to the Chinese Communist party to build EV batteries when we are already overly dependent on China for our critical minerals.\n\nAs a matter of fact, China is responsible for 60 percent of the worldwide production and 85 percent of the processing capacity. It is not just a matter of whether or not we mine the minerals here. It is a matter of whether we are able to process them or refine them. And I am not--I do not think there is a major rare earth refinery in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nSo, I just am concerned about where we are on critical minerals. I do not think our future is in electric vehicles, not in the short-term definitely, but I do think that this mass transition to renewables is making us even more--is creating an even greater national security risk because of our dependence on China for critical minerals and rare earths and the processing and refining."

Our goals of our national security and the security of our economy are not achievable as long as we have this dependence on China.

As we have heard today, my Republican colleagues would like to use this hearing to bolster this narrative that the Biden Administration is enacting a war on energy, and we recognize that that is a false--as falsely promoting this idea that combating the climate crisis is somehow mutually exclusive with promoting economic security.\n\nBut we know that this is a decades-old myth that has been used to excuse the unmitigated polluting of frontline communities especially, communities like mine and Braddock and the Mon Valley of Western Pennsylvania. For generations, communities like this, largely Black or Brown, or poor and working-class communities, have been kind of made into these sacrificial lambs, right, left to sacrifice their health, to sacrifice the air quality or the water quality in their communities, mostly for the sake of good jobs, but also for the economic prosperity that the Nation has enjoyed.\n\nPassage of the Inflation Reduction Act serves to prove that this argument is not just a false choice, but that we can, and we will, and we have the tools to fight the climate crisis while creating high-quality and union jobs.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the IRA is expected to create more than 200,000 jobs over the next decade, and it will incentivize investments in low-income and disinvested communities that have been harmed the most and that stand to lose the most. But to make these goals and the intent of the IRA a reality, implementation matters, of course.\n\nPresident Biden's Justice40 initiative, for instance, aims to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments, including investments in clean energy, workforce development, and the remediation of legacy pollution, go to disadvantaged communities.\n\nHowever, prioritizing grants funding through Justice40 is not enough on its own to combat decades of underinvestment and disinvestment of frontline energy communities.\n\nI am happy because I feel like in years past, some of these questions about how do our policies impact marginalized and frontline communities probably would have gone unasked. And I am proud that we have had several folks sitting here today ask these very questions.\n\nI do want to leave a second. If there is anything specific or even more specific, like, for instance, a community like mine that is a community that, for a long time, has not had the opportunity to turn a corner because we have not had the opportunity to think about the future economies, particularly as we think about steel, how can communities like mine, in the shadows of the steel industry, as it is struggling to figure out how and where it goes next, how does this--the IRA and the DOE impact our communities?"

That has actually achieved and steered and drawn investment to disadvantaged communities.\n\nWe are doing our part with our community benefits agreement. We have just stood up an entity called Ready, which is working with communities to know how to negotiate a community benefit agreement on their behalf--what do I ask for, et cetera--giving them technical assistance and making sure they have got a level playing field in negotiating.\n\nBut all of the work that Congress has done has given us the ability to help communities that have been at the back of the line."

And, similarly, again, as someone from Pittsburgh, I represent both a marginalized frontline community, and also a community where labor is incredibly important.\n\nPart of building a new energy economy is the development of a workforce that is high quality and unionized. A 2023 DOE Office of Energy Jobs report found that workers in the energy sector were more than 1.5 times more likely to be represented by a union or covered under a project labor or collective bargaining agreement.\n\nIn Western Pennsylvania, we know the value of good union jobs. So, it is crucial that Federal investments coming to our region and every other region benefit and strengthens our robust unionized workforce. And as we grow our unionized workforce, to be very clear, we also have the dual responsibility of ensuring we are creating pathways for those traditionally underrepresented in the trade unions, and particularly women and people of color, to participate.\n\nSecretary Granholm, how is the DOE working to ensure that the growing energy workforce includes high-quality union jobs, and even more specifically, the intent is to focus on labor agreements specifically, right? So, how is the Department prioritizing project labor agreements and competitive grants at locations to ensure we are supporting unionized workforce?"

I get along with them well. Some of them support me, but there is this almost hatred for non-union workers.\n\nAnd I hope the--there are rumors out there that, maybe, illegally on some contracts--and you do not do a lot of the contracting--they are giving preferences to unionized companies; in other words, discriminating against non-union. I know that should not be done, but that rumor is out there. And certainly, statements like that in which we, in essence, run down non-union workers and imply that we should not care about them are not helpful in an already divided country.\n\nIn any event, there is the mandate that we have a lot more electric vehicles within the next 7 years. I talked to a lot of my car dealers about it. They feel that we are--there is no way we are going to be generating enough electricity in this country to deal with this many.\n\nI would like to ask you, how much additional electricity do you think this country is going to have to generate in order to prepare for this onslaught of electric cars in 8 years?"

OK I kind of want to followup here on what Mr. Donalds said.\n\nRight now, we are kind of cutting back a little bit on the amount of natural gas we are producing, which will result in raising the cost of natural gas, which will be bad for the American middle class, like a lot of policies. Maybe the poor are subsidized, and the rich do not care, but it hurts the middle class. Not to mention it is going to drive up the price of natural gas for countries that export it, like Iran and Russia.\n\nCould you comment on that? I mean, the fact that, obviously, if we are restricting natural gas production, we will be driving up the cost or we could drive down the cost by producing more?"

It is great to be here with you.\n\nThe Department of Energy has sent a lot of money to the state of Florida, to strengthen and modernize our power grid, build resilience as the climate crisis worsens, creating better jobs, reducing energy burden and costs for disadvantaged communities. And this money is made possible thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nFlorida was not the only recipient. Obviously, you were also able to get the DOE to award funds directly to community organizations and solar companies in Puerto Rico, in a model that I have heard a lot about on a trip, actually, recently I took to Puerto Rico ensuring that the award was not bottlenecked with an administering agency.\n\nMy constituents want to see this model used more broadly across the Federal Government, especially for folks in Puerto Rico, for HUD awards, Department of Justice awards, et cetera.\n\nSo, I am just curious, how exactly does this model work, specifically as it relates to Puerto Rico? And can you talk about anything that you had to overcome, any administrative hurdles you had to overcome to make that happen?"

Congress gave us $1 billion to be able to do rooftop solar. Thank you so much for supporting that.\n\nWhat we have done is we went throughout all of the island to hear how we should be distributing this--how should we be prioritizing the putting of solar panels on homes? And citizens there said, to a person, please prioritize people with disabilities, people who are poor and in last mile communities, and people who have got a health issue. So, we have done that.\n\nAnd we have done this by tapping local community members who are in the best position to identify who those people are, verified, of course, through their--you know, are they qualified for SNAP, et cetera. They have to be a verification. But they are our eyes and ears and arms, really, on the ground to identify who should be able to get rooftop solar.\n\nSo, we are excited to begin that process. We hope that this summer we call the summer of solar for Puerto Rico and to be able to make people energy-independent in light of how fragile the grid is there."

Thank you so much for sharing that.\n\nYou know, what Americans want when it comes to Federal funding is more community engagement, empowerment by directly granting awards to local governments, community groups, advocacy--or nonprofits, organizations, and small businesses.\n\nNow, a lot of my colleagues on this Committee have been talking about their concern for American-made energy, and I want to talk about that. Fossil fuels, like coal, natural gas, petroleum products are driving the climate crisis, as we know. Clean energy comes from renewable, zero-emission sources, like solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomass sources.\n\nAnd the clean energy transition is urgent for humanity, but also for the state of Florida, as we are a frontline community in the climate crisis. Advances in technology and grid management, like those facilitated by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, shore up reliability of renewable energy.\n\nMadam Secretary, how can we combat the climate crisis without transitioning to clean energy?"

They see the fact that this is a $23 trillion global market, this clean energy. All of these countries are going to need the products to be able to get them to their goals.\n\nSo, we have friendly competition with our allies and our adversaries about who is going to get those jobs. And so, on the jobs front, this is very important, and it is why the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law have been so impactful that we have got 600 factories so far that have announced that they are expanding as a result of those incentives in the United States making us competitive globally.\n\nSo, from a global competition, economically, it is vital. Obviously, we have got to do our part from a climate change perspective as well. All of the countries do. So, we are working on both fronts, and actually, one complements the other. And it is a win-win."

You know, there is a really big choice that I think a lot of my residents want to make, which is the choice to breathe clean air.\n\nSecretary Granholm, you know this, throughout my public service career, I have represented numerous communities, frontline communities, that have had really some of the highest burden of hosting fossil fuel infrastructure.\n\nIt has never been clearer that we must rapidly phaseout fossil fuel production and transition to clean renewable energy. It is deeply disturbing to me that fossil fuel production is at a record high under the current Administration. And I know President Biden is fully aware of that position.\n\nI grew up in southwest Detroit, where I thought smelling like rotten eggs was normal, that all my friends had asthma was normal. To see in one of my communities I represented in the State House and then 4 years in Congress, 48217, to see white crosses in front of people's homes, I thought, you know, what is this about? It was a white cross campaign to say if anybody had cancer or survived cancer or somebody in their family died of cancer, they put a white cross on their front lawns, trying to humanize and understand the toll of hosting corporate polluters.\n\nEven now, in 48120 in my community, I have two very, very dense populated schools. And in their background is literally just--I mean, just one of the largest polluters in the state of Michigan. And I always look at Wayne County's Clean Air Act standards, and continuously we do not follow sulfur dioxide, and a number of other issues comes up over and over again with my residents.\n\nSo, it is important to me the decision what you all are doing regarding liquified natural gas. It is documented, well- documented, public health harms caused by LNG exports and how they are associated to larger harms to Black, Brown, indigenous communities, low-wealth communities. And so, LNG exports perpetuate, I think, systematic environmental racism and really just embedded in our fossil fuel economy.\n\nSo, Secretary Granholm, as a member of the White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council, do you believe DOE should consider environmental justice implications of approving additional LNG exports and extending the life of LNG terminals?"

It is one of the reasons why we are enthused that there is a whole component, for example, of the hydrogen hub that is focused on electrification of diesel trucks, of making sure that there are less--fewer particulates in the air that people are breathing.\n\nIt is clearly environmental justice, Justice40. Ensuring that we get clean investments into communities is embedded throughout not only the Department of Energy but the Administration."

Please, as DOE updates its studies that inform the public interest determination, that it would include meaningful public engagement with host communities as part of that process. I think that is incredibly important for the American people to be part of this process, that it is not a closed-door process, that they understand that they have a say in what they have to live with.\n\nThank you."

Couple these concerns with FERC's own forecast of summer supply shortfalls, and it is clear, I think, that we will have issues with reliability.\n\nMany experts have said that the Administration's ambitious power plant and carbon capture goals are not achievable in the desired timeframe with our current technology.\n\nSo, who is wrong here?"

And after one of the hosts was kind of condescending and insulting the intelligence of the 74 million people that voted for President Trump, you talked about--because they were talking about how the prices of everything are so high.\n\nYou talked about, well, in response, what the American people need to do is take advantage of tax credits to weatherize their homes and take advantage of credits to buy EVs.\n\nI found it kind of astounding, because I did not hear anything in your response--and I want to give you a chance today--to talk about how the American people need to deal with this.\n\nEnergy and Federal Government spending are the two greatest drivers of inflation, and it is eating Americans alive. They cannot afford rent. They cannot afford groceries. They cannot afford electricity, right there in your wheelhouse. They cannot afford gas.\n\nSo how are we, with the energy prices so high, with spending so high on a lot of these credits--by the way, EVs only make up 1 percent of the cars on the road--how are we driving down prices to help the American people?"

You got one group of Americans paying through their taxes EVs for another group, which, by the way, are not environmentally sound, in terms of the materials that go in them.\n\nAnd I would encourage you to read the book Red Cobalt that talks about the 40,000 children that work in the cobalt mines of Congo, some as young as 6.\n\nBut let us just stick with prices for a moment. Clearly has not worked here, but let us talk about abroad. The intelligence community has confirmed for me that--and a number of analysts have confirmed, I mean, obviously Russia fuels its economy on oil and gas. Iran fuels its economy on oil and gas. At about $55 a barrel, Russia can no longer fuel its war machine. It actually goes into kind of economic survival mode.\n\nSo, wouldn't it make sense to flood the global market with cleaner--you admitted in prior testimony American gas is cleaner than what came through Nord Stream Two, correct?"

Yes I mean, this is one of the things that I think was so important in the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is that it gave us an incentive to be able to offer, for example, 48(c) tax credits to former energy communities or energy communities that were challenged.\n\nAnd so, to be able to lure manufacturing to those communities is embedded in the tax laws that were passed by Congress. That is true for the way the Loan Programs Office is operating as well. There is a whole component there to be able to help loans for communities that have powered our Nation for the past 100 years."

To that end, I understand that DOE plans to issue a funding opportunity announcement for novel and innovative nuclear enrichment technologies.\n\nGiven that DOE has had this funding for nearly 2 years, can you provide a timeline on when that funding opportunity might be released and when DOE plans to make those awards?"

            "text": "Chairman Comer Well, we would like to work with you on that. And I have a community, Paducah, that is really ahead of the curve and working together.\n\nAnd I strongly encourage you--they have had a multiyear relationship with the DOE over the previous three or four administrations. So, we think there is a lot of opportunity there to where the community can work with DOE and lots of new opportunities for good-paying jobs.\n\nAnd in my remaining few seconds, I have to say that I want to make a plug. We are very blessed in America to have the greatest energy economy anywhere. That is anchored by the oil companies. And oil is something that--it is a commodity we use every day.\n\nI strongly encourage this Administration not to saddle the industry with excessive and burdensome rules and regulations that are only increasing the cost to consumers, which is fueling inflation in America.\n\nWe believe that our--as many of my colleagues have stated-- our energy opportunity is much greater than what we are utilizing now. And we believe the thing that is holding us back are bad policies and burdensome rules and regulations by the Biden Administration.\n\nSo, we strongly encourage you to work closely with the energy companies. Not only do they provide tremendous energy for American consumers; they provide good-paying jobs to their workers and pay a lot of taxes that keep our communities afloat. So, I wanted to mention that, because this was an energy hearing.\n\nI do not see any further questioners, so we will close.\n\nI want to thank you, Secretary, for being here today and for answering questions. The Oversight Committee is not as bad as they say on TV. Hopefully you will tell your colleagues in the Cabinet that this was a good experience, and hopefully we will see more of your Cabinet colleagues in front of this Committee, like we are supposed to do.\n\nSo, with that and without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days within which to submit materials and to submit additional written questions for the witnesses, which will be forwarded to the witnesses for their response.\n\nIf there is no further business, without objection, the Committee stands adjourned."
