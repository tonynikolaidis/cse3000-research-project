    "text": "Chairman Comer The Committee on Oversight and Accountability will come to order.\n\nI want to welcome everyone.\n\nWithout objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time.\n\nI now recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement.\n\nMadam Secretary, I want to thank you for being here today before the Committee. We are glad that you have returned safely after traveling to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates last week.\n\nI am sure you were well-received abroad, but I hope the purpose of your trip was not to urge these foreign nations to boost their output of fossil fuels, especially while President Biden and his Administration, including you as Secretary of the Department of Energy, have taken several actions to make the United States less energy independent, including by trying to shut down American fossil fuel production.\n\nPresident Biden and the Secretary should not be prioritizing foreign energy over American energy when we have the natural resources and producers to be energy independent. Unfortunately, the Biden Administration has pursued policies that have jeopardized economic opportunities, threatened U.S. energy security and national security, raised energy costs on Americans, and hurt American small businesses.\n\nToday marks the Committee's 15th hearing at the full and subcommittee level during the 118th Congress, specifically related to the Biden Administration's American energy policies and burdensome regulations. Our oversight hearings have examined a range of topics, including energy efficiency standards, critical minerals, nuclear energy, and the Administration's ban on liquified natural gas export permits to non-free trade agreement countries.\n\nDecisions like the Department's ban on new liquified natural gas export permits are just the most recent example of how the Department has jeopardized our energy security, jobs, and producers.\n\nAccording to the Center for LNG, increasing LNG exports provides great economic benefits, like bolstering labor incomes and lowering the cost of imported goods, thereby protecting consumers from inflation. Further, we know that increased U.S. LNG sent to Europe will safeguard the continent from reliance on Russian gas.\n\nRather than ask questions about the consequences of the LNG ban or other Administration policies, however, today, we will likely hear Committee Democrats demonize U.S. oil and gas producers.\n\nWhile Democrats politicize energy and target American producers, average national gasoline prices surged on President Biden's watch to an all-time high, with an average national price of gas reaching more than $5 a gallon in the summer of 2022. congressional Republicans share a different vision for America's energy future. On March 30, 2023, the Republican Majority House passed H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, which would reform the permitting process, lower process for consumers, and help restore U.S. energy leadership for the world. And today, the Committee has released a report detailing the harms the Biden Administration policies have inflicted on American consumers and the U.S. economy, which I will enter into the record with unanimous consent.\n\nWithout objection, so ordered.\n\nIt is undeniable that gas prices are higher under the Biden Administration, with gas prices surging to over $5 nationally in 2022 as a result of Biden Administration policies.\n\nAnd as the Biden Administration rapidly overloads our grid with its electrification-at-all-costs push, American consumers face skyrocketing electricity prices. Electricity prices have risen faster than the pace of inflation and more so than any other commodity.\n\nOur Committee's work in the 118th Congress has ranged from the Department's LNG ban, elimination of consumer choices for home appliances, historic depletion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and, of course, the waste of taxpayer dollars on the Secretary's now famous and disastrous 4-day summer 2023 electric vehicle road trip.\n\nThis work has expanded to include the Committee's governmentwide investigation into the Chinese Communist Party's ongoing efforts to target, influence, and undermine every sector and community in the United States, including the energy sector.\n\nBut the Biden Administration's rhetoric on climate change and adoption of radical Green New Deal policies, specifically its electronic vehicle mandates, play directly into China's hands.\n\nCommittee Republicans will continue to conduct oversight of government waste, fraud, and abuse. We will not stand by silently as the Biden Administration subverts America's energy independence and demonizes this critical industry.\n\nI now yield to the Ranking Member for his opening remarks."

    "text": "Mr. Raskin. Mr Chairman, thank you.\n\nThank you, Secretary Granholm, for joining us today. And I also hope that you are not traveling around the world promoting more fossil fuel combustion and use.\n\nMy colleagues had invited you here today to testify about President Biden's so-called war on energy, which we know does not exist. For better or worse, the United States is producing record high levels of oil and natural gas today. It has never been so high, so our colleagues can breathe easy if that is their principal interest.\n\nAt the same time, President Biden and the Department of Energy, in partnership with Democrats in Congress, are making historic and necessary investments in clean energy technology. Climate change is the defining crisis of our time, and we know that burning fossil fuels is, by far, the leading factor in contributing to climate change, a fact that fossil fuel companies knew about decades ago but suppressed.\n\nOur recent joint staff report with the Senate Budget Committee showed the evolution of Big Oil's efforts to deceive the American public, from outright denial of the facts that they understood in the 1960s and 1970s, and then more up-to- date subtle propaganda and disinformation efforts today to try to lead us away from the solutions that we need.\n\nBecause of this deception, we have lost crucial decades in which we could have been systematically transitioning away from dirty, polluting fossil fuels to the cleaner alternative energies we need. Now we are forced to take much more dramatic actions to transition to clean energy as quickly as possible.\n\nWith every passing day, the consequences of climate change grow in intensity. In just the last week, we have learned, not only are the sea levels rising, not only are we seeing record forest fires, record drought, record flooding in different parts of the country, hurricanes of record velocity, but there is even greater disruption taking place to people's daily lives. There are swarms of mosquitoes in Harris County, Texas, in unprecedented numbers and sizes. The oceans are actually changing colors. We are in a very rapid downward descent because of climate change.\n\nResearchers have found that the economic damage caused by climate change is six times worse than was previously predicted. A new paper estimates that just 1 degree Celsius of warming would cause the world's GDP to decline by 12 percent. We already hit more than 1 degree Celsius of warming since preindustrial times and are currently on track to hit 3 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century.\n\nWe must break free from the carbon trap, which will require significant effort and investment into the clean energy transition. The Department of Energy, I believe, is doing that, thanks to funding from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Because of these historic investments the American people have made, the U.S. is on track by 2030 to double the amount of clean energy we generate and to cut emissions by 40 to 50 percent compared to 2005 levels.\n\nThe Administration's focus on clean energy has also spurred over $400 billion of new investments in clean energy by private companies, about half of which is specifically being invested in manufacturing today. The U.S. economy has added 800,000 manufacturing jobs since the start of this Administration, and the Inflation Reduction Act is anticipated to create more than 1.5 million jobs over the next decade. We have not had an unemployment rate this low in more than 50 years, and the clean energy economy plays a very important role in this economic renaissance.\n\nUnlike my colleagues across the aisle who want to promote falsehoods about this imaginary war on energy, Democrats recognize that the transition to clean energy is not just good for our climate and good for our planet, but also good for our economy and good for our communities. Every single one of our districts is profiting right now from the benefits of projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure legislation.\n\nIn fact, a company in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, in the good Chairman's district, is receiving $480 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding for sustainable battery manufacturing. Another company in Calvert City, Kentucky, also in the Chairman's district, which I use by way of illustration, is receiving up to $35 million in Federal cost share under the Inflation Reduction Act to electrify and decarbonize its heating process.\n\nThis is taking place all over America today. This is happening now. These types of investments are significant and historic. They are exactly what we need to move away from the dangerous dependence on fossil fuels. And that is not a question of moral guilt. The whole society is implicated in it, but we have got to save ourselves from the implications of it.\n\nI commend the work of the Biden-Harris Administration. I commend you, Madam Secretary, for everything you have been doing to ensure the United States is able to transition effectively away from dirty energy to clean energy while also making sure that our economy is strong.\n\nThank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back."

    "text": "Secretary Granholm. Great Thank you so much.\n\nChairman Comer, Ranking Member Raskin, and Members of the Committee, I am so proud to be here representing more than 100,000 talented, hardworking public servants who make up the Department of Energy.\n\nThree years ago, I joined this Administration, believing that if America could come together around a national energy strategy, we could restore American manufacturing, we could create jobs, we could address the climate crisis and become energy independent and secure.\n\nAnd today, we are doing just that. America is back. Thanks to Congress' efforts and the President's vision, we are executing a focused, deliberate strategy that positions our businesses to dominate, our workers to compete, and our communities to thrive. And it is working. We are rebuilding our manufacturing backbone.\n\nSince the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, for example, companies have announced more than 600 new or expanded plants on American soil just for clean energy, hundreds of billions in planned investment, for batteries, for electric vehicles, solar, wind, nuclear and more; tens of thousands of jobs being created from the industrial Midwest to the industrious mid-Atlantic to the Southern battery belt to the Southwest sunbelt to the West Coast to the Gulf Coast.\n\nBy re-shoring and on-shoring manufacturing supply chains, we are also catching up to our global competitors. For example, right now, China possesses 65 percent of the world's lithium and 100 percent of its graphite, which are critical for 21st century technologies. But because of the President's investments, U.S. graphite production is expected to increase 25 fold by 2030. Lithium production is expected to increase 85 fold. And through it all, we have spurred a nationwide effort to modernize America's energy system, which will bring more clean power to more families at lower cost. For example, we are supporting the build-out of more than 600 miles of new transmission lines.\n\nThis strategy to strengthen America's energy security, to protect American jobs, and to save American families money is guiding our work across the Department. It is behind our successful usage of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves.\n\nOur sales in the summer of 2022, kept Russia's weaponization of energy markets from hurting our consumers at the pump. And now, our replenishment strategy has almost finished restoring those supplies at a bargain for the taxpayer.\n\nThe strategy has also guided our energy efficiency rulemaking process. For example, last month, DOE finalized energy conservation standards for domestic power transformers that will increase their efficiency and competitiveness, while saving American steel jobs.\n\nIn short, Congress and the President have crafted a historic strategy to invest in America, and DOE is proud to help implement it. We recognize that we have been entrusted with unprecedented resources to do so, and that is why at every step of the way, we are taking extra measures to protect the American taxpayer's investment, to meet the goals set forth by Congress, and to avoid potential for waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\nWe have set up new processes for our offices to coordinate on program designs so that we are eliminating redundancies, leveraging expertise across the Department, and learning from past experiences.\n\nFrom day one, we have prioritized hiring specialists in project and program oversight, in grant management, in contracting, financial and audit oversight. And we regularly and proactively seek guidance from DOE's Office of Inspector General on how to best protect the integrity of our investments.\n\nOur continued cooperation will be essential for keeping this momentum and building a stronger and safer future for the American people.\n\nI look forward to your questions. Thank you."

And that is really what we see happening, and that's the anticipation. That is why some states talk about rolling brownouts that are coming their way.

They estimated that would have a net of $400 billion cost.\n\nSince that bill has passed, now for those same programs, the estimate is that the subsidies will be $1.1 trillion over the same period of time.\n\nNow, of that, $7.5 million was generated for a nationwide electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

Think about the pattern in which the post office uses their vehicles. They charge them overnight. They use them in the morning. They deliver during the day, and then they come back and charge overnight. Those charging stations, if we had charging stations at every post office that were available to the public completely during the day--and post offices are everywhere, everywhere.\n\nSo, there is an opportunity here, but we have got to deploy the charging stations. They are close to everybody's homes. We have, you know, general mail facilities that could house hundreds of these charging stations. We could use them for our postal fleet overnight when nobody is using them, and then we could offer them to the public, perhaps, during the day.

PJM analysis showed that the deactivation of the Brandon Shores unit would cause severe voltage drop and thermal violations across seven PJM zones, which would lead to widespread reliability risk in Baltimore and the immediate surrounding area.''\n\nSo, let me make that plain for everybody. Brandon Shores, owned by Talen Energy, has entered into an agreement with the Sierra Club to not produce power, to not produce power. And so, the PJM, which operates in multiple states and schedules the power from various facilities, is asking that that agreement be held in abeyance until a reliable source can be built. But they are not going to do that.\n\nThe only thing that is going to save Baltimore from blacking out, from going without power, right, is an emergency designation from the Secretary and the Department of Energy. There is not enough time. Even if we wanted to build it--and we do not.\n\nAnd let me be clear here. The alternative is that Pennsylvania, where I live, provides the power, and our land is taken by eminent domain to send the power to Baltimore, who has a perfectly functioning power plant right now in Anne Arundel County, but because of the agreement, they are going to shut it down.\n\nSo, my two questions to start with for this are, is the Department of Energy in support of these type of agreements between the Sierra Club--like this--between the Sierra Club and Talen Energy to shut down plants, No. 1?\n\nAnd, No. 2, are you committed to the emergency declaration that is going to be required when the plant shuts down for over a million customers to have power and live in the 21st century?"

And also, it is essential that, while we prioritize the transition to clean energy, we also address the legacy of the pollution in our communities.\n\nWorld War II is still killing people in my district. For over 80 years, we have been grappling with the nuclear contamination left over from the Manhattan Project, particularly in Coldwater Creek, which is a main waterway central to our community, as well as West Lake Landfill.\n\nIn March of this year, the Senate passed legislation that would reauthorize the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or better known as RECA, which provides health screenings and compensation for people sickened by the U.S. testing of nuclear weapons, as well as expanded to include St. Louis and other areas that have been historically excluded.\n\nBut now we are running out of time in the House. RECA is currently set to expire on June 7. We only have four legislative days left.\n\nSecretary Granholm, do you support the reauthorization of RECA?"

There has been 12 entities that have been funded to reach out to communities who are potentially going to raise their hand and to decide how to compensate those communities for doing that service for our Nation.\n\nThat process is in the middle. It will take--it takes a bit of time. We are modeling it after a couple of other nations that did the same thing. It takes a bit of time to ensure that we get it right.

I would like to thank you firsthand for that investment in Ohio's 11th congressional District.\n\nNow, Secretary Granholm, can you share with us the size and scale of the investments the Biden-Harris Administration has been implementing since these laws were passed and, specifically, how they have brought investment and opportunity to disadvantaged low-income and marginalized communities?"

The Department of Energy, under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, is responsible for about $98 billion worth of funds to be able to make our Nation more energy independent and more--and have our energy run cleaner.\n\nWe have, as a result, given out grants, and they have taken advantage of tax credits, too, to companies that are producing the products to get us there. As we give out grants, we want to make sure that all communities benefit. So, we require, for any business that is seeking a grant, to do a community benefits agreement, so that shows how they are employing the local community, how they are benefiting the local community, and it is an agreement. So, we are monitoring, and we are enforcing those agreements.\n\nAnd as a result, we are seeing that double the amount of job creation and benefits are going to disadvantaged communities than the rest of the population relative to size. So, we are excited about that, and we are excited about--thank you--the incentives that have been built into the tax credits to locate in disadvantaged communities, because that, too, is causing great--you know, much more investment in communities that might not have seen it otherwise."

These stations must be constructed, distributed, and built equitably, prioritizing low-income and underserved communities. Since nearly every major auto manufacturer, from GM to Ford to Jeep, has plans to expand and convert to fully electric fleets within the next decade, along with other vehicles, like school buses and postal vans, we cannot leave these communities behind with this vital aspect of energy security and access to transportation.\n\nSo, Secretary Granholm, can you speak to how the Biden- Harris Administration is supporting construction of charging stations for marginalized communities?"

The $7.5 billion that Congress approved under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for charging includes a significant component to go to communities that do not have access to charging right now, particularly in cities, particularly poor communities, particularly rural communities, places where the private sector has not yet built out charging stations.\n\nAnd so, the challenge for all of that--so, for example, if it is in a dense, urban environment, where do you put the chargers, what if people do not have garages or access to a garage, what if they are in an apartment building? All of those questions, as a business model, we are trying to figure out how to incentivize access to charging stations in an easy way.\n\nOf course, putting them in parking lots that are available to the public is one thing, but along street parking, can you create chargers that you pull down from the street lamps, for example? Are there other ways, creative ways to use technology to be able to give people access to charging?\n\nSo, the bottom line is, we want charging to be ubiquitous, we want it to be accessible by everybody."

Madam Secretary, I first want to thank you for your strong leadership at the Department of Energy.\n\nToday, I want to talk a little bit with you about the broken and disconnected Texas grid, ERCOT, not just on behalf of Texans, but also because of the national implications of not fixing the Texas grid.\n\nI want to start off by thanking you and the Department of Energy for putting millions of dollars toward electric reliability in Texas, including a recent $30 million investment to help keep the lights on in San Antonio, Texas, but we still have a long way to go.\n\nWe have had so many mass power outages--in fact, hundreds of mass power outages--over the last few years in Texas, making us one of the most unreliable electric grids in the country. And most people remember and think about this as it relates to Winter Storm Uri where over 10 million Texans lost power, hundreds of people died.\n\nAnd in the wake of that storm, you, Madam Secretary, said many things I agree with. You said that interconnecting Texas' grid will be great for Texas. It will be great for Texas to consider connecting to its neighbors.\n\nYou said that interconnecting Texas could also benefit the rest of the country because in good times, Texas is generating all sorts of clean energy, which we could send those clean ions out from Texas to take advantage of a market that is eager to accept it and could not agree more.\n\nThat is why I introduced the Connect the Grid Act, which would require Texas to interconnect with its neighbors. My office worked with your Department to draft this legislation, and we relied heavily on your excellent transmission needs study, which pinpoints our Nation's most significant transmission needs and identifies national interest electric transmission corridors known as NIETCs.\n\nJust last week, the Department of Energy announced its preliminary list of NIETCs, a designation that is really important because it unlocks Federal financing for transmission, but Texas was missing from your list. And that was confusing to me because you and I agree that interconnecting Texas provides reliability, could save American lives, save tons of money, is an economic winner, and we cannot reach our climate goals without interconnecting the grid.\n\nThat is, in part, because Texas leads the country in wind generation. We are only second to California in solar generation. An upcoming MIT study finds that between 9 gigawatts and 36 gigawatts of interconnection between Texas and its neighbors could get us a 4 percent CO2 reduction nationwide and a 33 percent CO2 reduction in the state of Texas.\n\nSo, in the next few weeks, I want to send a letter to your Department urging you to do everything you can to interconnect the Texas grid, whether that is through funding transmission or through transmission planning and more. And I am interested in hearing from you, Madam Secretary, if you are considering adding Texas to your final list of NIETC designations, where does Texas fit into your transmission planning?"

And I stand by saying, of course, this is Texas' call, and so respect state sovereignty on this.\n\nBut I do think that when you consider the ability for a neighboring state to help in a time of crisis--and there is more and more of these extreme weather events that are happening and stressing grids--I think the Nation would love that. And, similarly, for those developers who are in Texas and who want to take advantage of the economy of clean energy to be able to export that power, I think, would be good for Texas, too.\n\nBut that is just me. I am just the Secretary of Energy. I am not in Texas, and I am not running Texas.\n\nSo, I look forward to working with you to see how we might be able to get there, but I do think it would be important to create a national grid that would include Texas at some point."

Investing in electric vehicles is good for the environment. It is good for people's pocketbooks.

As we have heard today, my Republican colleagues would like to use this hearing to bolster this narrative that the Biden Administration is enacting a war on energy, and we recognize that that is a false--as falsely promoting this idea that combating the climate crisis is somehow mutually exclusive with promoting economic security.\n\nBut we know that this is a decades-old myth that has been used to excuse the unmitigated polluting of frontline communities especially, communities like mine and Braddock and the Mon Valley of Western Pennsylvania. For generations, communities like this, largely Black or Brown, or poor and working-class communities, have been kind of made into these sacrificial lambs, right, left to sacrifice their health, to sacrifice the air quality or the water quality in their communities, mostly for the sake of good jobs, but also for the economic prosperity that the Nation has enjoyed.\n\nPassage of the Inflation Reduction Act serves to prove that this argument is not just a false choice, but that we can, and we will, and we have the tools to fight the climate crisis while creating high-quality and union jobs.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the IRA is expected to create more than 200,000 jobs over the next decade, and it will incentivize investments in low-income and disinvested communities that have been harmed the most and that stand to lose the most. But to make these goals and the intent of the IRA a reality, implementation matters, of course.\n\nPresident Biden's Justice40 initiative, for instance, aims to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments, including investments in clean energy, workforce development, and the remediation of legacy pollution, go to disadvantaged communities.\n\nHowever, prioritizing grants funding through Justice40 is not enough on its own to combat decades of underinvestment and disinvestment of frontline energy communities.\n\nI am happy because I feel like in years past, some of these questions about how do our policies impact marginalized and frontline communities probably would have gone unasked. And I am proud that we have had several folks sitting here today ask these very questions.\n\nI do want to leave a second. If there is anything specific or even more specific, like, for instance, a community like mine that is a community that, for a long time, has not had the opportunity to turn a corner because we have not had the opportunity to think about the future economies, particularly as we think about steel, how can communities like mine, in the shadows of the steel industry, as it is struggling to figure out how and where it goes next, how does this--the IRA and the DOE impact our communities?"

That has actually achieved and steered and drawn investment to disadvantaged communities.\n\nWe are doing our part with our community benefits agreement. We have just stood up an entity called Ready, which is working with communities to know how to negotiate a community benefit agreement on their behalf--what do I ask for, et cetera--giving them technical assistance and making sure they have got a level playing field in negotiating.\n\nBut all of the work that Congress has done has given us the ability to help communities that have been at the back of the line."

A 2023 DOE Office of Energy Jobs report found that workers in the energy sector were more than 1.5 times more likely to be represented by a union or covered under a project labor or collective bargaining agreement.\n\nIn Western Pennsylvania, we know the value of good union jobs. So, it is crucial that Federal investments coming to our region and every other region benefit and strengthens our robust unionized workforce. And as we grow our unionized workforce, to be very clear, we also have the dual responsibility of ensuring we are creating pathways for those traditionally underrepresented in the trade unions, and particularly women and people of color, to participate.\n\nSecretary Granholm, how is the DOE working to ensure that the growing energy workforce includes high-quality union jobs, and even more specifically, the intent is to focus on labor agreements specifically, right?

Not to mention it is going to drive up the price of natural gas for countries that export it, like Iran and Russia.\n\nCould you comment on that?

And this money is made possible thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.\n\nFlorida was not the only recipient. Obviously, you were also able to get the DOE to award funds directly to community organizations and solar companies in Puerto Rico, in a model that I have heard a lot about on a trip, actually, recently I took to Puerto Rico ensuring that the award was not bottlenecked with an administering agency.\n\nMy constituents want to see this model used more broadly across the Federal Government, especially for folks in Puerto Rico, for HUD awards, Department of Justice awards, et cetera.\n\nSo, I am just curious, how exactly does this model work, specifically as it relates to Puerto Rico?

And citizens there said, to a person, please prioritize people with disabilities, people who are poor and in last mile communities, and people who have got a health issue. So, we have done that.\n\nAnd we have done this by tapping local community members who are in the best position to identify who those people are, verified, of course, through their--you know, are they qualified for SNAP, et cetera. They have to be a verification. But they are our eyes and ears and arms, really, on the ground to identify who should be able to get rooftop solar.\n\nSo, we are excited to begin that process.

You know, there is a really big choice that I think a lot of my residents want to make, which is the choice to breathe clean air.\n\nSecretary Granholm, you know this, throughout my public service career, I have represented numerous communities, frontline communities, that have had really some of the highest burden of hosting fossil fuel infrastructure.\n\nIt has never been clearer that we must rapidly phaseout fossil fuel production and transition to clean renewable energy. It is deeply disturbing to me that fossil fuel production is at a record high under the current Administration. And I know President Biden is fully aware of that position.\n\nI grew up in southwest Detroit, where I thought smelling like rotten eggs was normal, that all my friends had asthma was normal. To see in one of my communities I represented in the State House and then 4 years in Congress, 48217, to see white crosses in front of people's homes, I thought, you know, what is this about? It was a white cross campaign to say if anybody had cancer or survived cancer or somebody in their family died of cancer, they put a white cross on their front lawns, trying to humanize and understand the toll of hosting corporate polluters.\n\nEven now, in 48120 in my community, I have two very, very dense populated schools. And in their background is literally just--I mean, just one of the largest polluters in the state of Michigan. And I always look at Wayne County's Clean Air Act standards, and continuously we do not follow sulfur dioxide, and a number of other issues comes up over and over again with my residents.\n\nSo, it is important to me the decision what you all are doing regarding liquified natural gas. It is documented, well- documented, public health harms caused by LNG exports and how they are associated to larger harms to Black, Brown, indigenous communities, low-wealth communities. And so, LNG exports perpetuate, I think, systematic environmental racism and really just embedded in our fossil fuel economy.\n\nSo, Secretary Granholm, as a member of the White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council, do you believe DOE should consider environmental justice implications of approving additional LNG exports and extending the life of LNG terminals?"
