I want to welcome everybody here.\n\nWithout objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time.\n\nI recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement.\n\nToday's hearing is an opportunity to discuss an issue every household in America is familiar with, with a clear failure of Bidenomics and the crisis caused by this current Administration's reckless spending. Joe Biden likes to say that Bidenomics is just another way of saying restoring the American Dream. I beg to differ. But just last week, the Consumer Price Index showed prices have risen 17.4 percent since Mr. Biden took office. That means that 26 months of consumers watching their paychecks disappear before their very eyes due to the rising costs of living. Worse yet, mortgage rates have nearly doubled since Joe Biden took office, making it much harder for Americans to buy a new home, and that is clearly not the American Dream.\n\nJoe Biden likes to say Bidenomics is about building from the middle out and the bottom up. That is a clever slogan, but it does not reflect reality. In fact, let me say this, those hurt most by these rising prices are low-income households and seniors that are relying on Social Security for their monthly retirement.\n\nWage growth has fallen behind the pace of inflation in 20 of the past 22 months, and most Americans are now unable to pay for the surprising expense of, you know, if there is something that cost $400, suddenly they are struggling to pay that bill, something that was unforeseen, and that is not building from the middle out or from the bottom up. Joe Biden likes to remind us he promised not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 a year, but as of June 2023, the average worker was paying an inflation tax, kind of an invisible tax because what inflation is, is a tax on everything that we need and have to buy. That 13.5 percent is effectively like a second Federal income tax, particularly for low-income earners. The truth is Bidenomics has been an abject disaster, and I think most of the American people know that.\n\nA recent poll found that 80 percent--let me say that again--80 percent of Americans credit Joe Biden's policies for the current state of the economy, and 70 percent agreed that their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation. And if you see any poll in the last year-and-a-half, 2 years, you have seen that the Biden Administration scores, of all the major topics that we discuss, they score the worst on the economy.\n\nOur current economic track is nothing short of unsustainable, yet the Biden Administration really does not seem to be concerned. In fact, Joe Biden considers the current environment a huge success, and he said that often on the campaign trail, proudly taking credit for every failed business that could not stay afloat under his crushing regulatory regime, or parents that are forced to pay bills with a credit card and then going into debt because their wages were not keeping up with inflation.\n\nAccording to Joe Biden, we are supposed to believe that we are actually better off today than we were when he took office, but the facts tell a very different story. The pain households are experiencing can be tied directly back to the disastrous policies posed by this Administration, which was so much reckless spending into the trillions of dollars. Now we are about to cap over $33 trillion in debt that our grandchildren and their grandchildren will have to pay.\n\nIn the early days of COVID, emergency spending did make some sense. It clearly did. I was not in Congress at that time. I believe my colleague, my Ranking Member, was not either, but the country was thrown into a tailspin, and we had to ensure that our economy did not capsize. However, this Administration plowed forward, maintaining these ``wartime'' spending levels long after the spending was necessary and really long after the pandemic was a national emergency any longer. It has been said ``never let a good crisis go to waste,'' and they did not. From the American Rescue Plan to the Inflation Reduction Act, the Administration has wasted no time throwing mindboggling numbers at varying crises at their choosing with seemingly no regard for the consequences. The Biden Administration apparently does not care if a gallon of milk cost six bucks--I know I do--or how much gasoline costs or an airline ticket, so long as it forces everyone to purchase an electric vehicle that costs more than the yearly median household income.\n\nDecades ago, Republicans banded together with the Contract with America to bring about some of the most impactful economic reforms seen in generations. By combining a series of targeted, fiscally conservative policies into one unified agenda, House Republicans paved the way for Americans everywhere to prosper. We have already seen the blueprint for what works, so we do not need to reinvent the wheel. We should go ahead and achieve that kind of success again, or at least that should be our goal. We have also seen the blueprint for what does not work, and thanks to Bidenomics, we have an ugly reminder of what anti-growth policies bring.\n\nI want to thank our witnesses, all four of you all, for being here today, and I look forward to a thoughtful discussion. The Chair now recognizes Ranking Member Bush for the purpose of making an opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:56:59.304744Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:17:15.732336Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1123,"annotations":[{"id":616,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"waDsFbEw6v","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"Zrh0R9eUOc","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-15T15:17:20.079721Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:17:20.079759Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":4.085,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"b5c01bd2-f81a-42e6-8953-7057162e39dc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":1123,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7bdef640-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":2,"text":"Ms. Bush Thank you, Mr. Chairman. St. Louis and I are here today to discuss the real economic situation of the people of this country. From gas prices to food, the cost of living is rising. New Census data indicates that real incomes fell significantly in 2022 as inflation reduced the size of our constituents' paychecks. We know there are investments that the Federal Government can make to reduce poverty.\n\nThe Republican Party's inability to govern has us rapidly moving toward a total government shutdown. This will disrupt important benefits and services for all of our constituents, such as food and cash assistance. Too many people across this country are struggling to make ends meet. A government shutdown would affect more than 42 million people who receive SNAP benefits, nearly 3 million people who receive TANF benefits, and over 6 million participants who receive WIC benefits. Congress pulled together in a crisis to provide COVID relief, this emergency relief that people needed.\n\nMy vision of a progressive economy led by the Biden Administration must include Medicare For All. It must include raising the Federal minimum wage, ensuring housing affordability, reinstating the child tax credit, and canceling student debt. That is my vision. During the pandemic, we made direct payments to families through the child tax credit and provided student debt relief by freezing interest and payments. We still need to do more now. These two concrete examples show Congress can ease the effects of economic hardship and boost the economy overall. When it was in place, the child tax credit lifted nearly 4 million children from poverty, causing child poverty to hit a historic low of 5.2 percent. The expanded child tax credit slashed child poverty, infused local economies with billions of dollars, and reduced food insecurity by nearly one-third. In Missouri alone, the child tax credit lifted 73,000 children out of poverty. Without the child tax credit, child poverty in the United States has more than doubled in just 1 year. Since its expiration, nearly 3.7 million children have fallen back into poverty, including the impacted children of Missouri.\n\nMillions of people in this country are buried in burdensome debt to make ends meet--medical, credit card, and student debt. Student debt payments will resume soon after numerous payment policies extended by the Biden Administration. Though that temporary relief has helped many, we need much more, and we must cancel student debt. The Federal student loan portfolio currently totals more than $2 trillion owed by over 40 million borrowers. Black people carry the heaviest debt burden, meaning student debt. Say it again. Student debt relief is a racial and economic justice issue. As lawmakers, we must ensure education leads to prosperity, education leads to opportunity rather than inescapable debt.\n\nWhile my Republican colleagues are slashing programs to help keep kids out of poverty and fighting against student debt relief every step of the way, we have an over $880 billion defense package moving forward. The money is there. The question is how we as elected officials choose to invest in our communities. The money is there. We can deliver for our constituents to help them out to not only survive, but to prosper.\n\nRepublicans are trying to distract us from the internal dysfunction which is steering our Nation toward a government shutdown. The question is, do we choose to invest in defense contractors or reduce poverty for millions of people? Thank you, and I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:56:59.304857Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:17:20.155990Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1124,"annotations":[{"id":617,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"XfNTTFxrdq","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"9nDgGUmrEL","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-15T15:17:32.855268Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:17:32.855295Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":12.414,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"f8464997-08e2-4762-8da0-e19773ab45ec","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":1124,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7bdef640-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":3,"text":"Mr. Fallon We have with us today an expert panel of witnesses who each bring valuable experiences and policy insights that will be beneficial to our discussion.

We advance policies that enhance people's freedom, opportunities, and well-being. My work focuses on expanding economic opportunities for women.\n\nWe are here to discuss ``Bidenomics: A Perfect Storm of Spending, Debt, and Inflation,'' and indeed this storm is already hammering suffering communities and homes nationwide. Evidence shows that President Biden's signature legislative packages, such as the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act, contributed to persistent inflation and are failing to bring it back down more sustainably. This increased government spending triggered more inflation, eroding wages and increased government spending and buying power. The White House has talked about an uptick in nominal wages, but as research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis shows, real wages have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels even as they are starting to rise nominally.\n\nFamilies are stretching their dollars further each day since their paychecks and retirement funds are worth far less than they were when President Biden took office. CNBC reported this year that an alarming 54 percent of the American public reported using savings to pay for everyday expenses, such as groceries and rent. Savings are down as is economic confidence.\n\nThe recent, multi-trillion dollar increases in government spending erode the value of the dollar through inflation because the money is expanding demand and driving prices up. CBO projects the Federal budget deficit in 2023 is $34 billion, more than the deficit recorded last year. That increase would be larger if not for a shift in the timing of certain payments and the spending cuts that were forced by House Republican leadership this past April in a sustainable manner.\n\nFraudulent actors may have stolen some $1 out of every $7 in pandemic unemployment, totaling as much as $135 billion, according to a new GAO report. That means that scammers made off with between 11 and 15 percent of the increased jobless benefits that Congress approved on a bipartisan basis early in the coronavirus crisis. This tragic waste of taxpayer money is stealing from American families, who are now more than $1 trillion in credit card debt, a historic high hit last month. That is Bidenomics in action.\n\nRegarding America's ticking debt bomb, The Wall Street Journal notes that the Congressional Budget Office regularly updates its long-term budget forecasts and says that U.S. debt held by the public will surpass gross domestic product this fiscal year, and that interest on the debt will equal about three-quarters of discretionary non-defense spending. By 2031, it will be as large. Medicare, Social Security and, of course, interest are legally non-negotiable. Military spending is not really optional either. It is no wonder that the Federal Government is described as an insurance company with an army.\n\nThese unsustainable public debt interest payments will crowd out important public expenditures for other discretionary needs. Congress must act now to cut spending in order to rein in these unsustainable debt and interest levels. Increased upward pressure on U.S. interest rates we are experiencing now will add additional pressure to businesses and the real estate market, which has experienced a significant constriction under Bidenomics.\n\nThe civilian labor force participation rate remains below pre-pandemic levels under Bidenomics. It is currently at 62.8 percent in August 2023, compared to 63.3 percent in February 2020. The Consumer Price Index stood at 3.67 percent on August 1, which is a steep drop below the inflation of 9.1 percent last summer, but it is still above the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target. And more importantly, a sharper measure of inflation is the Median Consumer Price Index, or median CPI. That measure was 5.72 percent at August 1, 2023, significantly higher than the standard CPI. That is why the headlines are, even though they sound rosier, the median CPI shows that families are actually still suffering significantly because of Bidenomics and inflation.\n\nWhile Bidenomics may define inflation as a high-class problem, as Ron Klain, the former chief of staff for Joe Biden said in the White House, most Americans disagree. The median CPI helps explain why in his recent CNN poll, 66 percent of Americans disapprove of how Biden has handled the economy with 76 percent describing the economy as in poor shape. Congress can act to help slow the ill effects of Bidenmomics through a return to the economic principles that built America's extraordinary economic engine: fiscal prudence, competition, and regulation that enhances rather than undermines fair competition and growth.

I am a public finance economist at the Heritage Foundation, where I research fiscal and monetary policy, with a particular focus on the Federal Reserve, and I am also a fellow at the Committee to Unleash Prosperity.\n\nThe last 3 years of public policy have been characterized, most notably, by excessive government spending, inflation, and anemic economic growth. Despite periods of near-record high Federal revenues by multiple measurements, we have seen deficits of $2.7 trillion, $1.4 trillion, and $1.6 trillion in fiscal years 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively, with the last month of 2023 being estimated, and with the deficit for Fiscal Year 2024 projected to be $1.9 trillion, yet another increase.\n\nMassive borrowing by the Treasury and monetary financing of deficits by the Federal Reserve created 40-year high inflation and imposed a hidden but heavy tax on the American people. Inflation transfers wealth from the people to the government, and, frankly, there is no better definition of a tax than that. It is worth pausing for a moment, as well, to emphasize that it is the government and only the government which can create inflation because it is only the government that has control over the money supply.\n\nA lot of scapegoats are thrown around for inflation, such as greedy businesses or spendthrift consumers or grasping unions trying to get higher wages, whatever the case may be. These are all tropes that were dragged out in the 1970's, and they are just as untrue today as they were then. As just one example, prices paid by businesses have actually increased faster under President Joe Biden than prices paid by consumers. If businesses are being greedy, they are certainly doing it wrong.\n\nPrices, on average, for consumers have increased 16.6 percent since President Joe Biden took office, and wages have not kept up. Meaning inflation adjusted weekly earnings are down 4.7 percent for the typical American family with two parents working and earning that average weekly pay. This has been a loss in annual purchasing power of over $5,100. Shockingly, the average American worker now loses more through the hidden tax of inflation on his hourly wages than he pays in Federal income tax. Similarly, household net worth has increased about $23 trillion during Mr. Biden's tenure, but nearly all of that is just inflation. Almost all the household net worth generated over the last 2 1\/2 years has effectively been transferred to the government through inflation. And while headline inflation has come down since June 2022, things are not improving for many Americans. Inflation has actually reaccelerated in the last 2 months, and the monthly change in real earnings was negative in both July and August. In terms of annual change, things have been even worse under Mr. Biden.\n\nAnnual weekly earnings growth has lagged inflation for all but the first 2 months and the last 3 months of Mr. Biden's presidency to date. The 26 months in between are record for consecutive annual declines in real earnings growth. As interest rates rise in the wake of 40-year high inflation, borrowing costs have risen for businesses, consumers, and the Treasury, creating an unsustainable problem for the United States Treasury and the current trajectory of both the deficit and the debt.\n\nIn terms of the American family, I estimate that for the typical American family, they are paying an additional $1,800 a year now in higher financing costs compared to January 2021. Coupled with the decline in real earnings, this leaves a family roughly $7,000 poor than when Biden took office. However, it should be emphasized that many Americans are even worse off than that. For those trying to buy a home today, the monthly mortgage payment on a median priced home has risen over $1,000 during that time, and so, it costs a family about $13,000 more per year every year over the life of a 30-year mortgage.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how Bidenomics, excessive government spending, borrowing, and creation of money has inflicted a tremendous amount of financial pain on the American people."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:56:59.305242Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:21:51.800862Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1129,"annotations":[{"id":622,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"p4mQFjT6P-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"PsWi-pY65i","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-15T15:21:54.813692Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:21:54.813716Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.77,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"2f2f2568-3d70-41d4-851a-ca8f16f1c1a2","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":1129,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7bdef640-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":8,"text":"Mr. Fallon Thank you.

Regulatory costs add another layer of hidden taxation, especially burdening small businesses and low-income households. The labor market has been affected by this agenda with real wages falling below pre-pandemic trends. According to the CBO, the Federal debt held by the public is already 98 percent of a year's GDP and would almost double to 181 percent by 2053 under current law. This is driven by Federal spending.\n\nGovernment spending has to be paid for either with taxes narrowly defined, such as income taxes, or taxes in the future, or the inflation tax. For example, the recent inflation surge translated to a $2.2 trillion unanticipated tax on debt holders administered in less than 3 years as the purchasing power of their assets was eroded. A recent econometric study concludes that the recent and previously unanticipated fiscal expansion in the U.S. and other OECD countries is likely a key driver of inflation in 2020 through 2022. Even without new tax legislation, inflation increases marginal tax rates on businesses and personal incomes, deterring business investment and reducing real wages.\n\nBeyond taxes, many regulations make workers less productive and, thereby, reduce the wages that they can earn. Others make consumer products, such as prescription drugs, automobiles, and internet service, more expensive. The rules finalized by the Biden Administration through the end of 2020 impose costs of nearly $10,000 per household. That is new. Of course, we had regulations before that, which is a $1,300 more than the new regulations that the Obama Administration had created during the comparable timeframe. If the 2021-2022 regulatory pace accelerates as it did in the Obama years, costs would near $60,000 per household after 8 years of rulemaking.\n\nPresident Trump's pace was in the opposite direction, saving the average household $80,000 compared to what the Biden Administration is doing. The $80,000 in regulatory costs far exceeds, for example, the revenue provisions of the Build Back Better Act, which would have cost only--only in Washington could I use that phrase--$14,000 per household if it had passed.\n\nFor the purposes of understanding economic consequences, the Biden agenda fits into two categories. One category would be redistributive policies that reduce employment, and the second category would be policies that reduce productivity and real wages. Redistributive policies distort the economy twice. First, as the revenue is raised, households and businesses change their behavior to alleviate the burden. Often this involves less investment in business capital, less investment in human capital, and less work. Other times investment in work are redirected to less productive uses.\n\nSecond, economic distortions are created as the revenue is dispersed, particularly regarding safety net programs. Households and businesses change their behavior to become eligible for the program or increase the benefit received. A good projection of the combined effect of the Biden spending regulatory and tax agenda is to reduce labor income, the income that workers get, by 5 to 6.5 percent. Unsurprisingly, the labor market is, in fact, falling short. Real employee compensation per adult was already 3.3 percent below the pre- pandemic trend as of the end of 2022.\n\nSmall businesses are especially burdened by taxes and regulations. New Federal regulations are regressive, meaning they proportionately hit lower-income households more than high-income households, especially because many rules, from health insurance to telecommunications to environment, are, in effect, forcing middle-and lower-class families to have champagne taste on a beer budget. Several policy options can reduce tax debt and\/or regulatory burdens.\n\nRegarding safety net programs, eligibility and benefit rules could return to, say, what they were in 2008 when we had a safety net, but not as large as it is now. Even though the latest poverty rate is 15 percent below what it was in 2008, the fraction of the population participating in Medicaid has increased more than 70 percent. Poverty goes down, but government program participation up. SNAP participation far exceeds the number of households in poverty. Safety net program integrity has also dramatically eroded. I am not sure there is much left with hundreds of billions of dollars spent that should not have been spent under the law. Federal healthcare programs can be reformed to require less revenue while providing greater value to patients.\n\nMore specifics are provided in my written testimony on the Trump Administration's Choice and Competition Report.

And even when the economy largely reopened, prime-age EPOP still stood roughly as low as the trough of the Great Recession, but rather than taking 10 years to recover, our economy did so in under 2 years. Our rapid recovery was possible only because of significant investment into the economy and the American people.\n\nThe Biden Administration built upon the previous COVID bills to provide relief and ensure the American economy was able to invest in the future. The American Rescue Plan expanded on many of the earlier critical programs. It was intended both to ensure households could weather a difficult economy and to ensure that the economy that we rebuilt would be better and more resilient. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden Administration made significant investments in the future. The result has been large progress.\n\nAmong G7 nations, the United States has had the strongest pandemic recovery, and, incredibly, U.S. real GDP has roughly returned to where CBO projected it would be before the pandemic even happened, as if COVID and the ensuing recession had never happened. Our historic recovery has also led to the strongest job market in U.S. history. Adjusting for demographics, the employment-to-population ratio is at its highest level in history, and black prime-age EPOP is hovering around its historic high with a historically small gap between black and white prime-age employment.\n\nThis strong job market has benefited the American people. Real average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees have matched their pre-pandemic trend also as if the pandemic had never happened, and gains have been particularly strong among lower-wage workers. Importantly, that has happened because inflation has come down. The United States also has the lowest core harmonized inflation among G7 countries. Further, the path in recent months is encouraging. Core CPI has been trending down since the spring of 2021, with a 3-month annualized average down to 2.4 percent. And even better, the contribution of housing rents to CPI inflation, which rose due to longstanding supply shortages in the U.S. meeting pandemic shifts in demand, is cooling and approaching pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWhile inflation rose to uncomfortable levels as the economy largely reopened, this was not caused by excessive stimulus. CBO estimates potential GDP, which measures how much the economy can produce without creating excessive inflation, and it believes that GDP ran barely above potential for only one quarter, and that the economy otherwise has run slightly below potential. In other words, our COVID response was appropriately sized. Instead, a global pandemic broke supply chains and caused monumental shifts in demand. It is impossible for inflation to not rise in the presence of supply chain issues and massive shifts in demand, but as supply chain issues subsided and companies shifted their supply and production to match new habits and demand, inflation has come down.\n\nThis progress is being threatened now by the work of the House Appropriations Committee Majority. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, non-defense discretionary funding, excluding VA medical care, or NDD Star, shrank as a percent of GDP in the first 2 years of the Biden Administration. Despite this, House Republican appropriators wrote levels $58 billion below the debt limit deal, which would leave NDD Star at its lowest level on record going back more than 60 years. Even worse, the cuts proposed to achieve this low level of funding are extreme. To highlight just three: Title I education grants would be cut by nearly 80 percent, money that ensures our drinking water is safe would be cut by 59 percent, and nutrition assistance for newborns and pregnant moms would also be cut. These cuts would harm the American people. Even worse, they seem to be the asking price for not forcing a government shutdown. Immediately during a government shutdown, some children with cancer would be denied treatment at NIH facilities, and some of our food would go without its health and safety inspections.\n\nThe government is supposed to work for the American people, and neither cutting programs that people rely on nor shutting down the government serves that purpose.

St. Louis and I are here today because our economy needs to fully recover from the devastating effects of the pandemic. Housing is the bedrock of our Nation's economy. One of the biggest challenges facing St. Louis and communities across the country is a dire shortage of affordable housing. When landlords raise rents, my constituents face increased housing insecurity and the threat of eviction.\n\nRenters in St. Louis and around the country are forced to contend with Wall Street investors who buy up homes in the area, jack up rents, and neglect building maintenance, all to extract greater profits. Private equity firms took advantage of unprecedented foreclosures during the 2008 recession, which forced millions of people from their homes. These corporations seized on historically low interest rates to purchase foreclosed homes. Local landlords and small business developers have been muscled out of the local housing market.\n\nIn 2022, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch estimated that out-of- state investors owned nearly 34,000 single-family homes in the region. Investors have doubled the percentage of homes they own in my district over the last 10 years. In one housing complex in my district called Ridgeview Apartments, the property has changed hands at least 4 times in the last 3 years. This wreaks havoc on residents and creates a dire lack of accountability. Ridgeview residents report there are so little communication that some people realize too late that they were sending their rent checks to the wrong place, and it is difficult to keep track of who their landlords are.\n\nThe St. Louis area is experiencing a housing crisis, and evictions are at the highest level in years and still on the rise. Wall Street speculators have turned places like Ridgeview from homes for families into assets on their balance sheets. Working families can no longer afford to buy or even rent many places that were previously affordable.

And to the extent that the economy does not work for a whole host of Americans, then that is not working for Americans.\n\nHomeownership is beneficial because it is forced savings that allows you to build equity and also pushes costs away from when you are stuck in a fixed-income later, and pushes it to when you are more able to afford it.

So, it becomes this hole that you cannot dig out of, and that is really the whole that is the fruit of Bidenomics to pile on consumer debt onto families. In terms of housing, I think it is important because housing is, you know, quite often the largest budget chunk of the family budget. First of all, the redlining was created by FDR, a racist administration. The FDR New Deal program was the one that created redlining, so that is very, very important to just historically put on the record.\n\nBut when it comes to housing supply, if you talk about St. Louis and other cities, the vast majority where these urban pockets of construction of housing supplies are constricted, they are run by Democrat regulation. They are run by progressive policies that constrict the supply of housing. So, if you want to have more housing supply, you need to have zoning regulation that is more competitive. And unfortunately, these areas where the worst housing supply constrictions occur are in progressive areas. And so, I would say that that is my recommendation in terms of improving housing supply.\n\nThe other massive increase in inflation is energy. And so, we see just recently, within the last couple of weeks, the Biden Administration again saying we are going to constrict drilling in Alaska and other areas of the United States. Who wins in this scenario? It is OPEC that wins. It is Russia that wins.

The first was to provide assistance right then, and the second thing was to try to make sure that we would have a strong job market coming out of the COVID recession. So, in the first part, it built on a lot of the bipartisan things in the Trump Administration. It sent out more money to families. It continued the expanded unemployment insurance at a lower rate as was necessary at that time. It expanded the Child Tax Credit and kind of made it a monthly benefit to make sure that working parents were able to--and also the most vulnerable parents--were able to better afford the cost of having children. So, that sort of stuff all helped families at the time.\n\nAnd then by also pumping money into the economy, helping invest in the future, it created the strongest job market in U.S. history.

Now, part of the reason why we are seeing the economy come roaring back is exactly because of the policies that this body passed last Congress and which President Biden helped to champion.\n\nSo first of all, I want to talk about the American Recovery Plan. Now, at the height of the pandemic, we had millions of Americans who were unemployed, people who did not know if they were going to lose their homes. They did not know if they are going to be able to buy groceries. They did not know if they were going to be able to go to the doctor, and we passed the American Recovery Plan to get through the pandemic. It was not intended to be a stimulus in and of itself at the onset. It was meant to keep millions of Americans from falling through the crack and the most significant economic disruption that this country has seen since the Great Depression, and that is what it did. It kept millions of American people housed. It kept food on their table. It helped children get through the huge catastrophic impacts, parents. That is what the American Recovery Plan was about.\n\nNow, subsequently, we have passed three significant bills that have been causing the GDP to do this. That is the CHIPS Act, which has helped to re-shore American manufacturing. It is the Inflation Reduction Act, which we have just been talking about. And it is the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which is going to rebuild our roads, our water systems, and all of the infrastructure that we know our communities need to have a thriving economy. And guess what? The data does not lie. The data show us that American manufacturing and investment in American manufacturing is coming back with astounding consequences, because here we are up here at the highest rate ever in American history.\n\nFinally, if my colleagues want to talk about inflation, let us compare American inflation to post-pandemic inflation in other countries. And what you can see in this chart in the testimony that has been provided to everyone on this Committee is that American inflation, with respect to other developed countries across the world, is at the lowest rates, lower than Canada, lower than the U.K., and lower than most of the European community.\n\nSo, if our folks want to talk about facts, let us talk about facts in the real world. The American economy is strong. It is coming back, but families are struggling. They are struggling because of the pandemic. They are struggling because we still have the effects of supply chain disruptions, of soaring housing costs and soaring food costs, and we have got to address them. And I can tell you factually one thing that is not going to make it better, and that is shutting down this government. So, if my friends on the Majority want to actually help American families, then pass the budget, and I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:56:59.317017Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:38:52.956944Z","inner_id":69,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1191,"annotations":[{"id":684,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"C5UN7AImHG","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"yNlnDQnbGN","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-15T15:38:55.378602Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:38:55.378627Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.169,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"73e48d95-280f-4dc0-86dd-1c63ee5a6663","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":1191,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7bdef640-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":70,"text":"Mr. Fallon The Chair now recognizes Mr. Langworthy from New York."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:56:59.317125Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:38:55.410945Z","inner_id":70,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1192,"annotations":[{"id":685,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"n91bhgyzWG","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"0-xUSwuBq_","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-15T15:39:22.622481Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:39:22.622505Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-15T15:39:21.026603Z","lead_time":26.988,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"ff9e4c7c-aed8-4aab-9a47-72433401a9f0","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":1192,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7bdef640-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":71,"text":"Mr. Langworthy Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to thank all of our witnesses today for being here, and the media has been busy championing the Administration's message of Bidenomics' success.

We have to understand that inflation, because it is a devaluation of the dollar for the sake of creating new dollars, when those new dollars come into existence, where did their value come from? A portion of the wealth of every other dollar that existed previously is siphoned away and goes into those new dollars. So as the government creates inflation, it is taking that wealth away from dollar holders. So that is how the government actually takes wealth away from you through the hidden tax of inflation, and all they need to do is do this at a fast enough rate that the amount of wealth being transferred is going to exceed the amount of wealth being transferred via the Federal income tax.\n\nTo be clear, this is not the first time that this has happened in our Nation's history.

You know, just one example here would be, let us say, someone in the middle class would buy fillet occasionally, but now they cannot afford to, so they just buy ground beef instead.\n\nYou are moving to a foodstuff which is already disproportionately purchased by people with lower income. So, what you have done now is not only is, if you want to call it an income effect from everyone having less money or less real money due to inflation so they can afford less.

Despite my colleagues' claims, the U.S. economy is actually growing, and this growth directly contrasts with failed Republican economy policies, policies that include the massive tax giveaway that former President Trump signed into law 2018, which prompted the most severe economic contraction in the United States since 1946 and cost the United States $1.9 billion.\n\nRepublicans' economic proposals do not work and are currently driving us toward a government shutdown that will hurt families and devastate our economy. Rather than having yet another hearing to bolster Republican talking points, we should be focused on funding the government. In less than 2 weeks, millions of families in need will lose access to vital programs such as SNAP, TANF, WIC, and the administration of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will grind to a halt because our Federal workforce will be unable to serve our communities.\n\nJust a couple of hours ago, House Republican leaders postponed the vote, voting on a rule to bring a stopgap bill to the floor. We also know that a shutdown would have a devastating impact on the economy. The partial shutdown from 2018-2019 reduced economic output in the United States by $11 billion over 2 quarters, $3 billion of which the economy never regained. The difference is clear and of massive consequences to our communities. Economic recovery should be the highest priority of the Biden Administration, and we are thankful.

You know, we have staffs that help us with our comments because we are spread out a little thin, but I took some notes during this hearing and I wanted to share them with you. So, you hear Members from each party make claims and then they cite statistics and studies, and if you had lived on another planet or another galaxy and you came to this hearing, you would be scratching your head going I do not know who to believe.\n\nSo, let us just talk about some indisputable facts. No. 1, inflation is now at a 40-year high. Nobody can dispute that. No. 2, interest rates are now at a 22-year high. That is also indisputable. Real weekly earnings have exceeded annual inflation for 5 of the 31 months, 84 percent of the time during this Administration. And if you want to talk about generational wealth, generational wealth is built on a foundation of three things to start: No. 1, graduate high school; No. 2, have a full-time job; and No. 3, do not have children until you are married. If you do those three tenets, regardless of race, religion, creed, region that you live in, it is very difficult to live below the poverty line. I am sure CNN or MSNBC will find somebody that did all those three things and is below the poverty line, but is absolutely the exception and not the rule.\n\nThen, we talk about the only Federal spending program that progressive Members ever want to talk about cutting is defense. That is the only one. Now, they ignore the fact that we live in a very small world, a very dangerous world, and a very interconnected world. And while they are all too comfortable, in fact, perfectly comfortable with cutting defense, they are also willing to give Ukraine a blank check for Ukrainian defense, which I find a little bit hypocritical or at least inconsistent. And then when you look at say 2022's deficit, which is the debt for that particular year, it was $1.38 trillion. So, if we did not spend $1 on defense, we would still have over a half a trillion dollars in deficit spending. Defense is not the issue. In fact, defense has been the slowest growing major Federal spending category since 2000, and even that 2000 year base, that base year, was following 10 years of post-cold war cuts. So, the U.S. military as a share of GDP remains the lowest level since World War II.\n\nSo, more spending is not the solution to inflation because if all of those spending programs worked as well as my Democratic colleagues have claimed, well, why did we stop at $3 trillion or $4 trillion of spending? Why didn't we spend $40 trillion if it is so good? And then let us talk about, because the American people or my friend from the other galaxy that attended this hearing, need to see contrasts. So, my colleague and Ranking Member mentioned about student loans and said that student loan forgiveness she fully supports. Well, I completely disagree because it is not student loan forgiveness. It is student loan transfer.\n\nFirst, that program would cost, general consensus, cost about $400 billion. And it would benefit, ironically, the highest earners will reap about two-thirds of that benefit of the giveaway. And then you have to think about, what about the folks that had never went to college? What about the folks that went to college and did not take out a loan? What about the folks that went to college, took out the loan, and then paid it back? Is that fair to them, and the answer to that question is, of course, no. It is patently unfair. It is patently un- American, in fact.\n\nThe outstanding Federal loan debt is about $1.7 trillion. There are 255 million adult Americans. Forty-five million have student loan debt, so that would make it to 210 million adult Americans would have to bear the burden for, not this forgiveness, but this transfer. And the median borrower, they did a study in 1992 and they just recently did another study and they found the same thing, that about four percent of their monthly income is spent on student loans. They got plenty of money to pay off their loans, and it also sets a horrible precedent to folks that willingly went into an agreement to say I will borrow money and I promise to pay it back. And then what about future borrowers that say, hey, they give loan forgiveness? I will sign this thing, but I am probably going to get forgiveness in the future, or, again, more accurately transfer. It is simply unfair.\n\nAnd so, we have to recognize the fact that we do have a $33 trillion debt. And I believe from CBO, that if we continue to spend at the rate we are going now, that in 10 years, half of the Federal budget will go to loan repayment, will go to paying service on the debt. That means that there is going to be less money for defense, there will be less money for infrastructure, and there will be less money, ironically, for entitlements.\n\nSo, I remember this very hyperbolic commercial that some organization put out where you had an actor playing Paul Ryan, and he was pushing grandma off the cliff. Well, it seems to me that folks that did not want to address this runaway spending, which would be my Democratic colleagues or at least most of them, are proverbially, hyperbolically are they pushing grandma off the cliff because it is going to be a heck of a lot less money for entitlements if we do not get our fiscal house in order.\n\nI want to thank the witnesses for coming today. Thank you for your testimony and your knowledge and sharing your points of view.\n\nAnd with that and without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days within which to submit materials and to submit additional written questions for the witnesses, which will be forwarded to the witnesses for their response."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:56:59.317883Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:42:00.558436Z","inner_id":81,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1203,"annotations":[{"id":696,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"IWocr0WrCw","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"8gEhjb7ztc","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-15T15:42:03.047536Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T15:42:03.047562Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.245,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"0f7430cd-169a-4e7d-971f-4c2dd49c6681","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":1203,"project":14,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"7bdef640-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":82,"text":"Mr. Fallon If there was no further business and without objection, the Subcommittee stands adjourned.
