The Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation will come to order. Welcome, everyone.\n\nWithout objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time.\n\nI would like to now ask unanimous consent for Representative Don Beyer from Virginia to be waived on to the Subcommittee for today's hearing for the purpose of asking questions. So, without objection, so ordered.\n\nI will now recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement.\n\nGood morning. Turn that frown upside down. It is going to be OK. Last October 30, the White House released a monumentally lengthy executive order on artificial intelligence, and the EO is not just long, it is broad. It corrals dozens of Federal agencies into a massive posse that is to go out and ride herd on every aspect of this emerging technology. But why the stampede? We are only just starting to grasp how AI can help and also harm humanity. That is why Congress is moving cautiously in this space.\n\nWe already have a plethora of laws in which AI uses are subject, ranging from anti-discrimination to consumer protection statutes, and unnecessary new laws could stifle AI innovation, slowing the arrival of life-enhancing and lifesaving breakthroughs. Not to mention, we do not want China on our heels, and we do not want to stifle innovation for the private sector or for our government agencies, especially in defense. That is why Congress is proceeding with a measured first do no harm approach. Where AI applications are not captured under an existing law, we need to close these loopholes. That is why I introduced a bill recently to ensure the distribution of nonconsensual pornography is not immune from criminal prosecution just because it has been altered via an AI deepfake process.\n\nBut Congress wisely has not authorized the Administration to go out and regulate AI differently than other technologies. But this executive order does so anyway and invokes the emergency powers of the Defense Production Act, or DPA, to require AI developers to notify the government if they are even considering developing new AI systems. It also mandates they regularly hand over highly sensitive proprietary data, like testing results, to the Commerce Department. What does this have to do with defense production?\n\nThe DPA gives the President extraordinary powers to ensure the supply of critical goods in time of war or national emergency, but we are not at war today, and if artificial intelligence is an emergency, it is not a temporary one. AI is not going to go away anytime soon, so the new executive powers this EO asserts have no logical sunset.\n\nThe bottom line is that this use of the DPA appears to be executive overreach and, quite frankly, illegal. That is the view of the attorneys general of 20 states, including my own home state of South Carolina. These AGs last month wrote a letter to the Commerce Secretary that argued the reporting regime in the EO lacks legal authority because the DPA allows for the Federal Government to promote and prioritize production, not to gatekeep and regulate emerging technologies. I want to thank my Attorney General, Alan Wilson, for stepping up to the plate and being a part of this letter.\n\nWhat is more, the gatekeeping in this EO seems more likely to harm than help our national defense. What is the biggest national security concern around AI? It is the risk that we relinquish our current lead in AI to China, and that could have catastrophic implications for our military preparedness. But requiring potential new AI developers to share critical data about their most valuable assets with the government could scare away would-be innovators and impede more ChatGPT-type breakthroughs. Not only that, but they might take their technology elsewhere, and we want the best AI developers, the best AI programmers, the best AI tech right here in the United States.\n\nAlso, how will the government protect that data it gets from AI firms? The EO could risk national security by mandating the creation of what Brookings Institution fellow, John Villasenor, calls a target list for any geopolitical adversary that might want to engage in cyber espionage or launch a large- scale cyberattack on U.S. AI computing infrastructure. He notes the government's poor record of preventing the exfiltration of data from Federal computer systems by malicious actors, including foreign enemies.\n\nTo be clear, the government does need to be proactive with respect to artificial intelligence. The executive branch needs to harness AI to strengthen national defense, bolster homeland security, and improve the administration of benefit programs. That is why I am glad that the EO contains numerous provisions to strengthen the government's own AI workforce and to enhance the government's ability to contract with private sector AI providers. But as the rubber hits the road on this EO, with the implementation deadlines already having begun to kick in, I look forward to hearing from our panelists today about where they believe it exceeds the President's legitimate authority and where it could impede American innovation.\n\nWith that, I will now yield to Ranking Member Connolly for his opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T12:42:23.735154Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:12:52.977280Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":954,"annotations":[{"id":445,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"T8PAzbzfVa","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"wSEMJczdxS","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"i65weAhT9h","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"9_pFMM7CV_","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:13:11.812513Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:13:11.812544Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-13T13:13:10.649948Z","lead_time":10.615,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"8bb9870e-e9e2-4499-825c-c89c33e74378","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":954,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d09b1520-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":2,"text":"Mr. Connolly Thank you. AI helps doctors optimize medical treatments, scientists predict potential natural disasters, and Federal workers manage water supplies, and yet we know very well every scientific and technological advancement comes with its own risks. The Biden-Harris executive order on AI, the first of its kind ever, elegantly balances innovation with equity and potential with pragmatism. AI has already demonstrated massive and consequential effects on workforces and economies around the globe. The Biden-Harris executive order sets America on a path to lead the world in ethical, equitable, and transparent use of AI.\n\nAs we enter the second hearing exploring the Biden-Harris EO, it is good to remember what our previous witnesses testified unanimously. One Republican witness, ``The AI executive order and OMB memo are important steps that focused on AI safety, investment, talent, and leadership, and are critical for America to lead in AI innovation and governance, but the executive branch cannot achieve this goal fully without Congress.'' Another Republican Majority witness: ``In sum, the AI executive order and OMB memo have taken a big first step, but it is only one step in a longer journey. Congress must now kick in.'' Another: ``The executive order recognizes the importance of the AI Risk Management Framework developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. We encourage the Administration to ensure that framework anchors the government's risk management efforts.'' These quotes all come from Majority-picked witnesses and agree that the Biden-Harris executive order promotes safe and responsible AI and puts us on the right path for a strong AI future in the United States, but they also recognize Congress has more work to do.\n\nJust last week, we had a hearing on deepfakes and learned how some AI training data sets contain known images of child sex abuse materials. As a result, some AI models trained off this data can further perpetuate the creation of additional terrible and shocking content. This example is just one way AI technology can cause harm when we allow it to go unregulated and unchecked.\n\nSo, how should we respond? As we have noted, the Biden- Harris EO initiated a whole-of-government approach and private sector involvement to establish the United States as a global leader in ethical AI. Within the Federal Government, the EO directed more than 50 Federal agencies to take more than 100 different actions to guarantee responsible Federal use in the over 700 use cases already implemented across 24 Federal agencies. Every agency should now have a designated chief AI officer and internal AI governance board, which should work cohesively and collaboratively to manage the risks of AI while prudently removing barriers to innovation.\n\nIn addition to the EO, President Biden established a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights to guide equitable uses of AI across the public and private sectors. It was another key step to ensure that every new technology comes with guarantees of civil rights, civil liberties, privacy, and equal opportunity. The blueprint also included private industry input from companies like Amazon, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, and OpenAI, each of whom committed to strengthening safety, security, and transparency as they proceed to innovate new AI algorithms and explore potential use cases for the technology.\n\nAs the Federal Government continues to explore AI, we should look to partner with private sector partners to foster continued innovation and adoption of a secure and trustworthy AI. I plan to introduce a bill that responsibly accelerates the use of AI by our civil servants who are entrusted with carrying out our public-facing agencies' missions. AI must empower workers, not replace them. We can achieve this future if we build a robust educational foundation and one that benefits both government and the private sector. Congress must invest in programs that educate and train the next generation of skilled AI workers, which the Chair has just mentioned, and they need to thrive in the tech economy. Both the private and public sectors will need digital native workers who are steeped in the practices needed to put appropriate guardrails in place to help AI achieve its goals.\n\nSome of my colleagues and witnesses here today will say that regulation limits innovation and stifles growth. It can, but let me remind you of what our previous witness, Dr. Rumman Chowdhury, a Responsible AI fellow at Harvard, said, ``Brakes help you drive faster.'' This country has a strong history of creating rules of the road for innovative industries in ways that catalyze growth and foster trust in consumers. We look forward to exploring how best we can achieve that balance, and I look forward to today's hearing.

Chairwoman Mace, Ranking Member Connolly, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for holding this hearing and for the invitation to appear before you. My name is Adam Thierer, and I am a Senior Fellow at the R Street Institute where I focus on emerging technology issues. I also recently served as Commissioner for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Commission on Artificial Intelligence, Competitiveness, Inclusion, and Innovation.\n\nMy message here today boils down to three main points. First, it is important to recall the foundational principles behind the bipartisan National Framework for Digital Commerce that Congress and the Clinton Administration crafted a quarter century ago. Freedom to innovate was made America's policy default. Lawmakers rejected the inefficient, old regulatory models of the analog era, which constrained entrepreneurialism and competition. We allowed new digital technologies to be born free and to flourish without excessive micromanagement, and then we used ongoing multistakeholder efforts and flexible regulatory responses to address concerns. Europe took the opposite path, and today, heavy-handed technocratic mandates have ``regulated its way to last place,'' as a recent Wall Street Journal headline observed. In fact, 18 of the 25 largest digital technology companies in the world today are U.S. based, while it is difficult to name any that are headquartered in Europe. While some people have concerns about large technology companies today, we should agree that it is better that these firms are primarily based here in the United States instead of China, Europe, or other countries or continents.\n\nFurther, there is a second point about the connection between AI policy and broader national objectives. A strong digital technology base is an important source of strength and prosperity, so it is essential that our Nation not shoot itself in the foot as the next great technological race gets underway with China and the rest of the world. Consider this scenario. When OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022, it quickly became the most rapidly adopted digital technology in history, and competing U.S. services from U.S. developers followed quickly. Had a Chinese operator launched a major generative AI model first, it would have been a Sputnik moment for America. Luckily, it is instead foreign nations who are today left scratching their heads, wondering how America once again raced ahead of them on digital technology. Wise policy choices not only strengthen our economy and provide better products and jobs, but also bolster our national security and allow our values to shape information technology platforms and markets globally. We need a national AI policy that is flexible and pro-innovation to make sure our firms, workers, and values continue to lead the world in this fashion.\n\nThis brings me to the Biden Administration's October executive order. This wide-ranging, 100-plus page directive has been praised by some as a logical response to congressional inaction on AI, but many others have rightly noted that it stretches executive authority over emerging technology well beyond statutory limits and raises the danger of overregulation. For example, the order flips the Defense Production Act on its head and converts a 1950's law, meant to encourage production, into an expansive regulatory edict intended to curtail some forms of algorithmic innovation. Twenty state attorneys general recently filed a letter with the Department of Commerce noting how the order is ``about regulating technological development, not about encouraging the production of anything,'' and also objecting to its effort to ``centralize government control over an emerging technology being developed by the private sector.''\n\nThe order also contains open-ended language about taking steps to combat algorithmic discrimination and pushes the Federal Trade Commission to get more aggressive in policing the AI marketplace. These steps open the door to a new regulatory regime for AI without any express authority from Congress. While other provisions of the order are more reasonable, Congress still needs to reassert itself to ensure that administrative overreach is curtailed and that agencies adhere to the Constitution and their congressionally delegated powers.\n\nInstead of these arbitrary, excessive mandates, Congress needs to craft an AI policy vision that does four things: first, it is rooted in a flexible, risk-based framework that relies more on ongoing, multistakeholder negotiations and evolutionary standards that are more closely matched to rapidly changing algorithmic technologies; second, which builds on existing government powers on a sectoral basis instead of trying to develop an entirely new regulatory superstructure for AI; third, which preempts state and local government AI laws that create confusing patchworks of conflicting mandates; and fourth and most importantly, gives algorithmic entrepreneurs a green light and avoids treating AI services as guilty until proven innocent as the executive order does.\n\nIn sum, our Nation must create a positive innovation culture and avoid trapping our AI innovators in a regulatory cage if we hope to prosper economically and ensure a safer, more secure technological base. It is essential that we strike the right policy balance as we face serious competition from China and other nations who are looking to counter America's early lead in computational systems and data-driven technologies.\n\nThank you for holding this hearing and thank you for the consideration of my views. I look forward to any questions you may have."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T12:42:23.735573Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:16:55.900341Z","inner_id":5,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":958,"annotations":[{"id":449,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"fdRpuCFinn","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"czh_zcJ7ap","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"epYW_daCo0","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"RMKV1VxpYL","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:16:59.041865Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:16:59.041894Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.743,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"cb91cd8d-efba-4bbb-a481-9c038d80454c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":958,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d09b1520-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":6,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you.

My name is Jennifer Huddleston, and I am a Technology Policy Research Fellow at the Cato Institute, where my research focuses primarily on the intersection of law and technologies, including issues related to the governance of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, better known as AI. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to testify today regarding the recent AI executive order issued by the Biden Administration.\n\nIn this testimony, I seek to focus on two key points: first, how the AI EO represents a significant shift in the U.S. approach to AI policy and to technology policy in general; and second, how the AI EO raises concerns about appropriate separation of powers at a time when Congress is debating the most sensible policy framework to consider for governing AI.\n\nTo begin with, the AI EO represents a significant shift from a more permissionless approach to general purpose technology and technology policy in general, to a more permissioned or precautionary approach, such as those more commonly found in Europe. While much of the conversation around AI has been recently focused on the generative AI products like ChatGPT or DALL-E that became popular with consumers in late 2022, AI and machine learning has been part of our lives for far longer than many of us may realize. From tools that help detect potential credit card fraud, to our talk-to-text or autocompletes on our phones, to various things that help make us find better and faster search results, we have all been using artificial intelligence far longer than we may realize. AI is helping fight wildfires and enabling stroke victims to speak again, and it is estimated that AI could increase productivity by 1.5 percent per year and global GDP by $7 trillion over the next decade.\n\nAll of this is to say, while much of the conversation is focused on the potential harms of AI, we should not forget the benefits as well. In fact, not all uses of AI can be predicted. As we have seen with the internet, one of the things that really allowed the U.S. to flourish and one of the reasons why the light touch approach gave rise to so many of the wonderful products that we have today, is that consumers and innovators were able to decide what products were the best applications, not government bureaucrats.\n\nWhile the AI EO may be the most significant AI policy that we have seen at an executive level, it is not the first executive that has mentioned AI. In fact, both the Trump Administration and the Biden Administration had comments on AI and the importance that it may serve for economic growth and its valuable tool in the future. Notably, the Biden Administration's executive order looks less favorably on the potential for a less regulatory approach to this technology, and it suggests that there is a case for action amongst agencies. It nudges agencies in a do-something direction more so than prior administrations, particularly in its invocation of the Defense Production Act.\n\nThis brings me to the second point today. The AI EO should raise significant concerns about appropriate separation of powers. Not only does this represent a change in the overall approach to technology, it occurs at a time when Congress is actively debating this issue and it occurs by executive order, while we have seen many committees, including today's hearing, on a wide range of topics in both the House and the Senate, consider whether or not a further regulatory framework for AI is necessary.\n\nThe most notable example of this is the AI EO's use of the Defense Production Act to justify its provisions. This law was originally designed to provide the executive with authority to meet a national security cris, but the AI EO evokes the Defense Production Act, not to respond to such a crisis, but, rather, to require innovators of AI products, deemed high risk, notify the government and submit to government-run red teaming regarding the potential risk of their innovation. This executive overreach cannot be presumed to have occurred because there is a need for immediate action or because there is a lack of attention on Congress' part, and the powers that it passes on to the administrative state should be considered carefully by Congress. As we know, once power is given to the administrative state, it is unlikely to be returned.\n\nThe United States' light touch approach to the internet helped enabled its global leadership and realize the economic potential of this technology in the past years. This has benefited both consumers and innovators and entrepreneurs. As we encounter our next disruptive technology era with AI, we must consider not only the risk, but also the benefits of such technology, many of which we may be unable to predict. The United States has a chance to distinguish itself from more regulatory approaches once again and embrace an approach that allows consumers and innovators to use technology to find creative solutions to problems and needs.\n\nI thank you for this opportunity to testify before you, and I welcome your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T12:42:23.735761Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:18:56.780229Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":960,"annotations":[{"id":451,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"WUuVyBSj0S","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"UWo36JMvyR","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"9hSoUtIX04","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"sDyJ5288nS","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:19:00.796448Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:19:00.796478Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.688,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"ab0083c9-a792-4a66-ac7c-1626cce49716","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":960,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d09b1520-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":8,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you.

I am Neil Chilson, the head of AI policy at the Abundance Institute. The Abundance Institute is a mission-driven, nonprofit (c)(3) dedicated to fostering widespread human prosperity by creating an environment where emerging technologies, including AI, can thrive. Thank you for having me here today to talk about the executive order on artificial intelligence.\n\nThe artificial intelligence EO, as noted by the Chair, is long. In fact, it is the longest regulatory EO in history. According to data from the American Presidency Project, the AI EO is 88 times longer than the median executive order. By the numbers, it is the third longest executive order in American history, but the two EOs that are longer are a 1951 executive order containing the entire manual for the military court martial procedures and a 1980 EO revising that manual. The AI EO is also unusually regulatory because it directs actions by dozens of agencies and Federal officials. It mandates 136 different deliverables, such as reports, guidance documents, and dozens of new projects, processes, and plans.\n\nIn short, the AI executive order is unprecedented. Our country's history includes many dramatic developments, including civil war, mass industrialization, two world wars, globalization, and global pandemics, yet no President has ever issued such a long and detailed executive order to reorient the Federal Government on a policy issue.\n\nThe executive order will generate sweeping activity across the Federal Government, redirecting at least tens of millions of tax dollars and hundreds of thousands of hours of government effort. Some of that activity will be productive and appropriate, particularly where it focuses on the government's own use of AI, but the executive order overreaches in at least two ways. First, the President lacks the authority to impose the executive order's Section 4.2's obligations on private companies. The executive order claims authority under the Defense Production Act, which is a Korean War-era law intended to reduce one very specific type of national security risk-- threats to ``the ability of the domestic industrial base to supply materials and services that are needed for national defense and disaster recovery.''\n\nBut the DPA does not authorize Section 4.2 for three reasons. First, there is no threat to the ability of the domestic industrial base to supply AI capabilities. The U.S. leads the world in supplying AI capabilities. Indeed, the White House, if anything, seems concerned with an oversupply of AI capabilities. As the EO itself notes, AI capabilities are advancing at rapid speed. Second, even if there were such a threat, Section 4.2 will not increase production of AI capability. Section 4.2 surveils an entire industry segment for various potential risks unrelated to production. The only production Section 4.2 will promote will be the production of highly sensitive commercial and cybersecurity information from companies to the government. Third, and most fundamentally, the DPA simply cannot shortcut the constitutionally established method of democratic lawmaking in the U.S. As we have heard, Congress is actively considering 28 AI-related bills. The DPA does not empower the President to skip ahead of Congress on this.\n\nThe EO overreaches in a second way. The executive order's definition of ``artificial intelligence'' is so broad that it covers common everyday software, from social media content moderation algorithms, to insurance models, to common consumer and business financial tools. This broad definition means that many of the regulatory actions spurred by the executive order could apply not just to AI companies, but to any software developer in industries, such as transportation, education, healthcare, or energy. Even were it desirable to revise the U.S.'s highly successful approach to software regulation, doing so through a Presidential executive order is inappropriate. Such a change deserves to be considered, refined, and decided by Congress.\n\nIn conclusion, the executive order could have focused on establishing a positive vision for a future of AI while protecting civil rights from government misuse of these technologies. Instead, it usurps Congress, abusing the DPA to impose new regulations, and spurring regulatory action that will affect the entire software industry. This overreach calls for continued congressional oversight, democratic accountability, and potentially legislative or judicial course correction. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T12:42:23.735932Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:26:33.095629Z","inner_id":9,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":962,"annotations":[{"id":453,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"9nsF62LNz1","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"t3lx3-_j82","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"84LkJikxVp","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"bB-E2zCeQd","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:26:39.442800Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:26:39.442826Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":6.065,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"3bf33d71-535e-44b3-87d7-8d729d1c563f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":962,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d09b1520-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":10,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you.

I am Dr. Nicol Turner Lee, Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution, which has a 100 year history of evidence-based, nonpartisan research, and I thank you, Chairwoman, for the mention.\n\nWith that being said in my brief remarks, I just want to remind people that getting to the EO has been a long, deliberate, participatory process, and it has been one in which we have had several government actions proceeding and surrounding it, such as the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights released in October 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technologies AI Risk Management Framework released in 2023, the securing of voluntary commitments by some of the top companies in July 2023, and the OMB guidance released shortly after October in November 2023. These actions reflect a whole- of-governance governance approach, and they are really important for us to achieve national guidance as AI becomes both an asset and concern for our national security interests.\n\nI want to also share that Congress must act quickly on many of these proposals in our decision to maintain our status as leaders in the global economy. Rather than say that this is overreach, I consider these efforts to be preparation toward a more responsible, inclusive AI ecosystem. This first formidable action on AI under the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights shared a nonbinding roadmap for the responsible use of artificial intelligence. We then proceeded to have NIST, who gave us the risk management framework as a multi-tool for organizations to design and manage trustworthy and responsible technologies that are meant to be voluntary, rights preserving, nonspecific, use case agnostic. NIST is also going to release a playbook that will be a companion to this, and we recently launched the AI Safety Institute Consortium to bring stakeholders together to jointly develop and diffuse best practices, standards, and other things.\n\nA few months later, as it was mentioned, the White House secured voluntary commitments from some of the leading U.S.- based AI companies that want to equally ensure safety, security, trust with advanced systems. They are willing to not only look at their own business models, but to find ways to engage in public reporting of their system capabilities, limitations, and guidelines for use. The most notable advancement, so far, is the Robust Watermarking Solution that these companies are working on together to ensure that we can authenticate AI-generated content.\n\nWhile the executive order may appear to be a variety of issues packaged into one, it is intentionally designed to be such. We have put in the work to make sure we have gotten to this point, and the EO will not only pursue the eight benchmarks that are outlined in its mandate, it also, on a cumulative level, has pursued us to look at best practice for AI use in criminal justice, education, healthcare, and other thoughtful processes that develop an astute and ready workforce. The actions to engage the Federal Government is probably the most ambitious, yet necessary, action to confirm our resilience among foreign actors and others who want to leverage malicious attacks.\n\nIn my written statement, I opine more on the January 24 progress report issued by the White House, which suggests that we actually are meeting many of those benchmarks, even in light of some of the concerns of my colleagues. Going forward, if the U.S. wants to be a leader in innovation, we must be responsibly prepared to manage those risks. AI can be developed with positive intentions, such as saving the climate, and simultaneously lean into negative uses, such as a large-scale generation and dissemination of misinformation and deepfakes, activities that are quickly appending important democratic institutions, like voting and elections infrastructure. Moreover, the advanced capabilities of frontier models, like generative AI, will only deepen these effects, particularly if our government does not act quickly to get ahead of this technology. Again, instead of seeing this as overreach, this is a whole-of-government approach that is thoughtful, participatory, coordinated, and have been percolating for a matter of years.\n\nMore importantly, if Congress does not act, states will, China will, and other nations who are not only leading us in comprehensive legislation, but will soon be the standards that are going to develop the AI ecosystem. That is why we have urgent assignment to move and legislate on what is actually in the EO. More so, instead of having a patchwork of state laws and local provisions, it is important that Congress be concerned about these interests of AI simply on the national security interests, simply on the public consumer protection concerns, and more so because we want to be the leaders in this technology.\n\nI urge Congress to consider that we already have many proposals that have some bipartisan support, like the National AI Commission Act, the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, and let us move so that we do not have to continue this conversation again."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T12:42:23.736229Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:27:31.665524Z","inner_id":11,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":964,"annotations":[{"id":455,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"9M_rfvN_Lq","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"GbkkssltCU","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"hHNwqZyDRx","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"DFS9LeVbYX","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:28:30.256076Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:28:30.256103Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":58.308,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"6c2f94f4-82bb-4194-a5ba-9d125b75e587","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":964,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d09b1520-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":12,"text":"Ms. Mace Thank you so much.

OK Can I interrupt you because I get that point, too, and I made a note of that. You went on to say it actually usurps the role of Congress. You said that. Well, you know, we do have a government with three branches, and we are a co-equal branch of government. So is the executive. And when one of those branches fails to act, that creates a vacuum that almost demands the others act, depending on the urgency of the situation. Now, it is nice to say, and I am a big champion of legislative prerogatives, and I believe Article I is Article I for a reason, and Article II is Article II for a reason, namely we are supposed to be the predominant arbiter of government. That was certainly what was in Madison's mind, but that is a different conversation.\n\nSo, in the first session of the 117th Congress, we signed into law about a hundred bills, very far reaching in some cases, very visionary. In this Congress, 31, and half of them are post office namings. This is not a serious Congress. You mentioned, I think, 28 bills addressing AI. Not one has become law, and given our pace, it is unlikely any of them will become law in this Congress. We are not doing anything, and when that happens, it seems to me the President has an obligation to address an urgent and imminent subject like AI. And so, even though I share your passion about the prerogatives and responsibilities of the legislative branch, in this particular case, I have to defend the executive branch. They have not usurped Congress. They have actually done what Congress ought to do but is not going to do because we are not doing our jobs up here. In fact, we are not only not doing our jobs, we are actually regressing.\n\nSo, in the appropriations bill, Nancy and I and others are going to vote on this week, apparently, they have zeroed out a congressionally created fund--by the way, I worked with Will Hurd on this, a Republican--the technology management fund, because apparently we do not need any more investment in technology. You know, we do not need more cyber capability. We do not need more AI training. We do not need any of that stuff. We do not need to protect data bases that you are worried about being compromised. And so, we are going to zero out the technology management fund created by Congress. So, we are going backward, we are not going forwards, and I just respectfully disagree with you. I do not think the executive order, I do not care how long it is myself, and I do not think that is a particularly viable critique. And with respect to usurping Congress, I do not think so.\n\nNow, the third critique I think you had in your testimony was overreach and echoed by your two colleagues on the other side of the panel. I want to give Dr. Turner Lee an opportunity to address that one. So, is it overreach? I mean, should we be worried that they have gone too far, and they are intruding in our lives, and they are going to compromise the ability of AI and all of its promise?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T12:42:23.738564Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:36:03.660996Z","inner_id":43,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":996,"annotations":[{"id":488,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"PwkgBj6GyT","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"1YupNUjVH8","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Ga3GEH9_r3","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"K-1WzwZmkG","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:36:10.467356Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:36:10.467382Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":6.56,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"874ec757-db4a-4262-9f4e-e2315458f8bc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":996,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d09b1520-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":44,"text":"Dr. Turner Lee I would disagree with it being overreach. When I started in this space back in the early 2000's--I have been in technology since then when we were looking at regular data bases and stuff--we did not have any framework for predictive decisionmaking, and we had many conversations on algorithmic bias. We were seeing that people were having equal opportunities foreclosed simply because an algorithm made a decision. That was the very first basic step at looking at algorithmic discrimination and stuff like that. Now we have advanced capabilities through frontier models that are actually extracting data-text, voice, images--in ways that actually are so opaque and less transparent that we need more guidance. The technology continues to outpace policy in that matter. With that being the case, to your point, I think we have had many congressional bills that have come to the Floor, but they have been too late, so we have had to relitigate and remitigate what those bills are. In addition to that, we have been slow to the pace when it comes to data privacy protections, reevaluating our civil rights framework, things like that. I, in no way, think this is overreach.\n\nAs a scholar at Brookings who is interested in trying to figure out proactive, evidence-based strategies to move forward, this is actually preparation.

I guess, first, I just want to respond to my colleague's, across the aisle, indictment of this Congress. Us not doing anything this Congress is a response to my colleagues across the aisle spending about $7 trillion last Congress, and it has really caused my constituents a lot of problems. Inflation is through the roof. The cost of energy, groceries, interest rates are up. It is really costing Americans a lot. And so, we are struggling with our $34 trillion in debt. We are struggling with the fact that every hundred days we add a trillion dollars to our national debt, and really, our fiscal situation is out of control. So, we are very concerned about that, and we are going to try to find a path forward that is sustainable for the American people, that will give our kids and grandkids the American Dream for generations to come, but I am very fearful that that is not going to work out.

I am privy to a lot of briefings, classified briefings, about what our adversaries are doing, what they are up to, technology wise, even AI. And, you know, one of my greatest concerns from a national security perspective is advances that some of our adversaries are. Like, you know, I feel China is right on our heels, and I do not want to, I guess, limit our ability to keep up with the technology.\n\nAnd, you know, I have met with a lot of different tech firms and seen a lot of the benefits of AI. One of them, for example, is a company that maps the world every single day with 200-plus satellites in space. They can map every inch of the earth every single day. Now, a year ago, this company, they were doing great. If you need to find a little widget or target or something on the map on earth, it could take a couple of hours, maybe take a couple of days, but they would eventually find it. With the avenue of AI, they have condensed it down to minutes and hours. Within 6 months, they have condensed down the amount of time that it takes to be able to find some particular piece of equipment or object here on earth, so huge advances.\n\nI would never, ever, ever, ever want to see government regulation, government requirements stifle our ability for this American company to advance technology as fast as it has. It has been remarkable, and I meet with this company about every 6 months, and the innovation that I see is tremendous. And there are a lot of applications with a lot of different agencies, and not just the public sector, not just DoD, but the private sector as well.

Much appreciated. I had a couple of hearings at the same time. That is how they do everything here. Everything happens at once, but I apologize. I was in a hearing down the corridor on Financial Services. I want to thank the witnesses. I have read your bios, and I appreciate the expertise and the intellect that you bring to this hearing. So, thank you very much for helping the Committee with its work. This is one of those areas that we are really grappling with. The velocity of change has been incredible, and I think we are racing to catch up.\n\nAs reported by the United States intelligence community in its Worldwide Threat Assessment recently, Russia, China, North Korea, and other state actors are continuing to conduct malign influence operations aimed at disseminating disinformation and magnifying U.S. societal divisions and interfering with the upcoming U.S. elections. They are doing this in other countries as well, but we are principally concerned about this country and this election right now. So, as you might imagine, the introduction of generative AI sort of amplifies the possibilities of this exacerbated threat.\n\nI know that FBI Director Chris Wray recently testified to the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. He said that, ``This election cycle, the U.S. will face more adversaries moving at a faster pace and enabled by new technology,'' speaking of AI. He also went on to say that advances in generative AI make it ``easier for both more and less sophisticated foreign adversaries to engage in malign influence.''\n\nAnd today, virtually, as you know, anyone can weaponize AI to create fake but convincing photos, videos, and audio clips with the purpose of election interference or manipulation. Just recently, 2 days before the New Hampshire Presidential primary--I am sure you heard of it--thousands of residents of New Hampshire received robocalls that used an AI voice cloning software to imitate President Biden. It was rather convincing as well. The robocall encouraged recipients not to vote in the primary election and ``save your vote for the November election,'' so you can easily see how, you know, this technology might be used for nefarious purposes.\n\nDr. Turner Lee, what effect can we expect AI-generated deepfakes and misinformation to have on Americans' trust, their trust in the election process?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T12:42:23.760035Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:49:47.111451Z","inner_id":161,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1114,"annotations":[{"id":606,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"e61YpVRuEd","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"g1PPMggxcU","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"PLm8lAHqac","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"2pFJho5cU-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-13T13:49:50.774324Z","updated_at":"2025-06-13T13:49:50.774350Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.412,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"64259e94-4319-4351-b0b1-3706f04fc5d8","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":1114,"project":13,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"d09b1520-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":162,"text":"Dr. Turner Lee Thank you for that, and I am very happy that you brought this up as part of this conversation. As the Brennan Center has reported on a variety of their reports, we definitely need to address AI-generated content that is leading into misinformation and disinformation to ensure that we have an informed electorate and to also have electoral infrastructure in process that is not harmed by malicious actors or other malfeasances that are relying on synthetic media or artificially generated content that will dissuade voters. And that, I think, applies to everybody in this room, regardless of your party, your residents, et cetera. You know, we all need to make sure we are going to the polls with that kind of information.\n\nWith that being said, it is really important for us to get a handle on this. I think one of the things that we did not do in this panel that we often do in others is we sort of talk about AI and generative AI as if they are the same thing. You know, generative AI has more advanced capabilities of extraction of voice, image, text in ways that we cannot often find out where it originated from. And so having, as we see in the executive order, these industries commit to helping us with a better digital watermarking system, being able to have conversations around copyright protections, really determining ways in which we engage the public in general education so that they are more informed about misinformation, I think are particularly important. And Congress has actually had some bipartisan action on this that I think we should take heed of if we are going to get these elections right now and into the future.\n\nI would just also suggest to you, Congressman, that states are also taking this very seriously. My colleagues at Brookings, we are looking at, you know, what states are doing, and I think there are some synergies between Federal action and concern and state action and concern.

So, how a certain social media platform may respond to concerns about AI-generated images in an election context or in an election ad context may look different than how a search engine does or how another tool does when it is, for example, dealing with voice as opposed to video. We have seen that, oftentimes, allowing these different norms to play out will allow consumers to get appropriate amounts of information in that context because it will look different on each platform and each tool, as opposed to a government one-size-fits-all approach, where not only do you have concerns about the potential impact on speech, you also have concerns about, given the broad definition of AI, how much content could this apply to, and might it bring in things that are more common.
