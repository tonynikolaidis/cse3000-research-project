Welcome, everybody.\n\nWithout objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time.\n\nI recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement.\n\nWelcome to the first hearing of the Subcommittee on Health Care and Financial Services for the 118th Congress. To the witnesses, thank you very much for your attendance and participation in today's hearing on the inflation crisis.\n\nI think it is most important to understand how we got here so we don't make the same mistakes going forward, and we can do better going forward. We first have to agree that we have a problem before we can fix it and move forward for the American people. When the pandemic began in March 2020, Congress and Federal agencies took quick action to deliver financial relief to the American people. Congress quickly enacted a series of five laws providing over $3.1 trillion in Federal funds to mitigate the economic and public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPresident Trump's pro-growth and pro-worker economy, created by the Tax Cuts and Job Act, and investing in American manufacturing, combined with the unparalleled response to the pandemic, created the fastest economic recovery in history. As a result, only $1.9 trillion of the COVID relief funds were spent by January 2021, leaving over a trillion dollars for further relief.\n\nBetween the start of the pandemic in March 2020 and March 2021, inflation rose 2.6 percent. The Food Index rose 3.5 percent. Energy services increased by only 4.1 percent, and gasoline prices increased by $0.67 to $2.89 a gallon. Instead of allowing these policies to continue supplementing the successful economic recovery efforts, Democrats jammed through Congress another $1.9 trillion, claiming it was for pandemic relief.\n\nI want to remind everyone that we still had at that time $1 trillion leftover from the relief packages that we hadn't spent yet, and the definition of ``inflation'' is too many dollars chasing too few goods. Republicans and economic leaders of both parties, including Larry Summers, Greg Mankiw, and Michael Strain, warned that this completely unnecessary spending would put the economy at risk of inflation and possibly recession. Congressional Democrats simply did not listen to the experts. They were determined to spend more money. Government clearly has a spending problem. Then exactly what Republicans and economic experts predicted actually happened.\n\nIn 2020, inflation rose to a 40-year high. The price of groceries went through the roof, gas prices soared, and retirement accounts plummeted. Between March 2021 and March 2022, inflation rose 8.5 percent. The Food Index rose 8.8 percent, the largest increase since 1981. Welcome back, Jimmy Carter. The Energy Services Index rose by 13 percent, more than triple the rate it did the year prior under Trump despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and gasoline prices increased $1.43 to $4.32.\n\nWhat was the Democrats' response? More spending. They pushed through the wrongly named, I might add, Inflation Reduction Act, another $740 billion boondoggle which did nothing to fight inflation, but it did spend more than $360 billion on climate policies and funded 87,000 IRS agents. I am not sure how that helps the pandemic, but this is on top of $3.1 trillion and $1.9 trillion. Democrats decided to spend even more money, and let me remind you that we still have left over money to this day from those relief packages.\n\nDemocrats' spending spree over last Congress drove the prices of groceries up by more than 11 percent. Their spending spree and attack on American energy caused Americans across the country to pay 27 percent more to heat their homes this winter. Inflation driven by Democrat policies made Michiganders choose between heating their homes and buying groceries. I don't know if you all know, but it gets cold in Michigan, especially this winter.\n\nThen what was President Biden's solution to the skyrocketing energy inflation? He told Americans to buy expensive electric vehicles. Now, mind you, in Michigan, we didn't have the infrastructure, the charging stations, nor the money to buy these electric vehicles. But President Biden's ``let them eat cake'' response illustrates just how little he and congressional Democrats care about the impact of the reckless spending policies have had on working Americans.\n\nThis Committee stood on the sidelines for too long while Americans across the country were feeling the pressure of inflation brought on by the Biden administration and congressional Democrats. Today, we hear from experts to better understand how inflation could have been prevented and what this administration and Congress must do to address it. I thank you and look forward to your testimony.\n\nI yield now to Ranking Member Porter, for her opening statements. Thank you."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T14:18:25.408932Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:20:00.356376Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3564,"annotations":[{"id":1259,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"_oDEZ0-Jxh","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"iImYMvjjJT","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"RLN_SItjlX","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"ZkOu0iaWVi","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"5jtXDi8I3o","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:20:30.532520Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:20:30.532547Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T18:20:10.298848Z","lead_time":29.835,"prediction":{},"result_count":5,"unique_id":"b5a5890f-4d53-4022-98e3-66b5b9a0a649","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":3564,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"1caac6c9-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":2,"text":"Ms. Porter Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman. It is great to join you at our first Subcommittee hearing together, and I look forward to working across the aisle to oversee and strengthen our capitalist economy.\n\nToday, we begin our work by discussing inflation. My Republican friends titled this hearing, ``Inflation: A Preventable Crisis.'' So, I think our first task is to dig into what they think was preventable. Let's rule a few things out. We all know that Congress couldn't have prevented a once-in-a- century pandemic or Putin's illegal war in Ukraine. We all know Congress couldn't have prevented the strain on our supply chains when people started trading consumption of services for goods during COVID, and we all know Congress couldn't have immediately fixed our strained supply chains to reduce inflation. After all, it took decades for Washington to crack our supply chains by underinvesting in infrastructure, ignoring price gouging monopolies, and letting corporations offshore manufacturing.\n\nSo, we have ruled out Congress preventing the economic shocks and the resulting effects that led to inflation, but still, our Republican friends are suggesting that something about inflation was a choice. Well, I suppose it was a choice to help people suffering the economic impacts of COVID, but to me, that help wasn't really a choice. It was a necessity, but it seems like today's hearing could turn into a forum to blame American fiscal policy for the global phenomenon of inflation. If American fiscal policy created inflation as a crisis that is being felt in countries across the globe, then American fiscal policy should equally be able to solve that crisis.\n\nSo, what policies do Republicans think will solve global inflation? Is it deep cuts to social programs like Social Security and Medicare that would devastate our seniors and working families, or maybe it is just the REIN IN Act, which Republicans passed last week, which requires the President to consider the inflationary impact of executive orders. The problem is the REIN IN Act commissions a report. It is not a comprehensive look at the costs and benefits of executive orders. Does that really help us make more informed fiscal decisions, or is it just designed to discourage executive orders?\n\nEither way, the REIN IN Act still just commissions reports. It takes no real action. If that was House Republicans' secret plan to fight inflation, it is going to be a long two years for American families. Either Republicans don't have a plan to address inflation while making life better for families, or they are too afraid to admit that their plan is to take away deeply popular and needed programs from the American people.\n\nLet's contrast that with what Democrats have been up to. We passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which would cap the price of insulin for seniors, allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, lower the cost of health insurance, and lower the cost of renewable energy, all while reining in inflation by paying down the national debt. We passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to invest billions in our ports and airports to stop the supply chain bottlenecks that have spiked prices during the pandemic. We passed the CHIPS for America Act that will bring back domestic manufacturing that Washington let move overseas for decades, injecting competition and resiliency into our markets that lowers prices. And perhaps most importantly, we have had a President who has taken executive action to break up monopolies, chipping away at the power big corporations have enjoyed to gouge huge profit margins and raise prices on consumers. These are the kinds of actions that contain inflation, make life better for families, and shore up our economic resiliency.\n\nToday, I am calling on House Republicans to please put forward your own plan to fight inflation that is at least as detailed as the Inflation Reduction Act. It is time the American people see where you stand, not see you grandstand. I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T14:18:25.409041Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:20:30.560602Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3565,"annotations":[{"id":1260,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"6sybIgh3kC","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"IITREIHU7W","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"GhgpQIp76A","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"xp2K1_mOSE","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"IEiCz5iWH-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:20:38.389410Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:20:38.389438Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.496,"prediction":{},"result_count":5,"unique_id":"39fd91d3-affb-4469-b5a6-768016decb53","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":3565,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"1caac6c9-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":3,"text":"Mrs. McClain Thank you, Ms. Porter.

You have my written statement. Let me say three things briefly, and then I look forward to answering your questions.\n\nPoint No. 1 is that inflation really took root in 2021. At the beginning of 2021, in January, year-over-year CPI inflation was 1.4 percent. One year later, in January 2022, it was 7.5 percent. This marks one of only three years in which CPI inflation grew by six percentage points in a single year in the postwar United States. So, what are the sources of this sharp run up in 2021? Well, the Chair alluded to some of them in her opening remarks. One was excessive monetary stimulus. The Federal Reserve responded aggressively to the arrival of the pandemic recession, cut rates to zero, made an open-ended commitment to provide liquidity to markets, and, importantly, started buying $90 billion a month of Treasuries and mortgage- backed securities, and it continues to do so in 2021. Even as inflation started to creep up, it maintained this pace through the entire year.\n\nIn addition, there was excessive fiscal stimulus, the American Rescue Plan, $1.9 trillion in stimulus, was enacted in March 2021 at a time when the U.S. economy was growing at 6.5 percent. It was plain in the data, things like GDPNow at the Atlanta Fed showed that. At a time when the measured output gap between what GDP was running at and what its potential was, as calculated by my old shop, the Congressional Budget Office, that budget gap was $400 billion to $600 billion. You don't need a $1.9 trillion bill to close a $400 billion to $600 billion output gap, so it was just much too big and destined to cause macroeconomic disruptions.\n\nAnd there were, as well, supply chain constraints from around the globe, but to the extent that you recognize supply constraints, you should be even more restrictive in your fiscal stimulus because it is only demand relative to supply that matters. So in 2021, inflation really, really ramped up, and that, I think, is the period that was most crucial and where the biggest policy errors were made.\n\nPoint No. 2 is that once inflation gets embedded in the economy, policymakers have essentially no good choices. Choice No. 1 is live with the inflation. When it got to 10 percent, that was clearly unpalatable. American households were deeply dissatisfied and being harmed by the inflation. The alternative is to live with the things necessary to bring it back into control, and that is a steady stream of bad news in the terms of house prices start going down, retail sales declining, slower growth in jobs in the labor market. And as a result, that initial policy, it gets compounded into further costs down the line as you deal with taking the inflation out of the system.\n\nPoint No. 3 is we are hardly done with this episode. In the most recent readings, CPI inflation was 6.4 percent year-over- year, well above two-percent target. The core, taking out the volatile food and energy components, was still at 5.6, but for me, the really striking numbers are food, energy, and shelter are 50 percent of the CPI. That is because they are about 50 percent of the typical family budget, and food, energy, and shelter still rising at 8.5 percent year-over-year. Go to the gasoline station, go to the grocery, go home and be reminded that your paycheck is nearly 10 percent less valuable than a year before.\n\nAnd inside that, shelter is really the poster child for the inflation problem. Shelter is a third of the CPI. Year-over- year inflation, shelter inflation is 7.9 percent. It has risen every month since February 2021. We have yet to see a peak, and shelter isn't something that has a supply chain. It is in the United States. Shelter is a service, and services are the U.S. inflation problem right now. Goods price inflation has been, in fact, addressed to some extent, and the Federal Reserve, in particular, will need to do more to address the inflation problem.\n\nI will just close with something which I find sort of slightly depressing on the inflation front. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation is a geeky thing called the market-based Price Index for personal consumption expenditures. We don't want to talk about that in public, but I will be happy to answer questions later. But it is really just indicative of what transactions are actually happening in the economy right now. When they started their tightening in April 2022, year- over-year market-based core PCE was 4.9 percent. In January 2023, it was 4.9 percent. That is very little progress on the underlying inflation, which means that as the tightening the Fed has done so far gets into neutral, there is more to do to really address the inflation.\n\nSo, I thank you for the chance to be here today, and I would be happy to answer your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T14:18:25.409267Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:22:46.600590Z","inner_id":5,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3568,"annotations":[{"id":1263,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"3_h0VyAd-V","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"pp7lo0EZsu","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"m7CL3bun8F","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"RBoNdnCIZY","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"nSL7w8gz3m","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:22:48.286949Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:22:48.286987Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1.419,"prediction":{},"result_count":5,"unique_id":"ca25f8c6-44bd-40f4-a834-15f8ab9c4324","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":3568,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"1caac6c9-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":6,"text":"Mrs. McClain Thank you, sir.

Inflation is such an important topic. I am going to focus most of my remarks on that, in particular, the monetary policy aspects of that.\n\nFor several years, starting back in 2017, the Fed began to move to a more rules-based monetary policy, and it worked well for the United States in 1980's, 1990's, and in other years. Many papers were written at the Fed and other places showing the benefits of the so-called rules-based policies. In July 2017, when Janet Yellen was the Chair of the Fed, a whole section on rules-based monetary policy was put in the monetary policy report. The target inflation rate was only two percent.\n\nMany monetary policy experts made favorable comments about the rules-based policy. J. Powell, for example, said, ``I find these rule prescriptions helpful.'' Evidence was that with the move toward rules-based policy was beneficial, economic performance improved. Unfortunately, this moved toward monetary policy rules was interrupted when the pandemic hit in 2020. First, rules were removed from the Fed's report. They were put back in in February 2021. Then rules were taken out again in February 2022. But Chair Powell, in answer to complaints from Members of Congress about rising inflation, said he would put the rules back in. And in the report released on June 17, 2022, policy rules were back.\n\nThis approach of including rules in the report has continued, and it appeared last Friday, in the March 3, 2023 report. A copy of the table is in my prepared testimony, but let me just mention the Taylor rule was first on the list. And the Fed admitted that throughout 2021 and 2022, the target range for the Federal funds rate was below the prescriptions of most simple rules. I think it is good that rules are back in the Fed's monetary policy report. It would be more helpful if the Fed formally incorporated rules into its actual decisions and apparently has been trying to do this recently. At first, only small changes were seen in actual monetary policy as inflation rose sharply, as you just heard. This was the case of the Fed and other central banks who are behind the curve. So, we are still living in a high inflation era, unless monetary policy actions are taken.\n\nEvents in Ukraine raised inflation, but not the basic story. Figure 1 in my prepared testimony shows the effective Federal funds rate through late 2022 through the present. The rate moved from 25 basis points to 4-and-a-half percent, but that is still probably too low. While the gap between the rules and the effective rate has narrowed, the huge discrepancy still exists.\n\nDuring March 2022, the actual Federal funds rate was well behind the curve. Why? If we use the Taylor Rule, which is in the Fed's report, the most recent monetary policy report in particular, you plug in an inflation rate over the past four quarters of only four percent, a target inflation of two percent, which the Fed says we are still taking it to, an equilibrium interest rate of one percent, which is a consensus at this point, lower than I assumed originally, and the gap between real GDP and its potential of zero--we are pretty close to zero, low unemployment--then you get a Federal funds rate of six percent. These are mild assumptions. So, even with these mild inflation numbers, the Fed is still behind the curve, though, as Chair Powell indicated this week in testimony, they are still trying to catch up, so we will see.\n\nMy written testimony shows that the Fed got way behind the curve in detail compared to the rules-based monetary policy, and it says this is why inflation rose so much. The Fed has started on a method to get inflation back down. By reviewing the years leading up to the present situation, the formal testimony provides the background needed for analyzing the current and future monetary policy decisions.\n\nThere are now more reasons than ever for central banks, including the Fed, to use the more rules-based policy, to keep inflation at the two-percent target range. Central banks should start now on procedures or rules that markets understand. The policy interest rate would increase as inflation rises, as has now just begun to happen. It would, of course, be a contingency plan, as are all rules. This would greatly reduce the chances of a large, damaging change later.

My name is Mike Konczal, I am the director of macroeconomic analysis at the Roosevelt Institute.\n\nToday I am going to speak about the causes of inflation that have been unique to this recovery, the progress we have made so far, and what policymakers can do to bring down inflation further. But first, it is important to remember this recovery has been remarkable. The economy has added more than 500,000 jobs each month for the past two years. There are now 4 million more jobs in the February 2021 CBO projection of what would have happened without the American Rescue Plan. In contrast to previous recessions, real GDP is recovering to projections of where it would have been without the pandemic, but we have also experienced inflation has been higher and more sustained than financial markets and the Federal Reserve projected.\n\nThere has been four key contributors to inflation during the past two years, and we have heard stories about people canceling gym memberships and buying home gym equipment instead. And the first contributor, the shift in demand from services to goods, has been aggregated across the entire economy. Second, vulnerabilities in our supply chains, many of which already lacked resiliency pre-COVID, led to skyrocketing prices for goods in summer of 2021, yet during this time, the prices for services did not fall. As the economy reopened, inflation and services picked up even as supply chains were still normalizing. This all mechanically increases inflation.\n\nThird has been the change in demand for housing resulting from remote work, which now covers over a quarter of the work force. One study by the San Francisco Fed found that these shifting patterns of demand for housing explain half of the overall increases in house prices and rents during the past two years, all of which has been a major contributor to inflation. And fourth, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 also increased inflation, especially through energy and food prices. Thanks to U.S.-led domestic and international efforts, especially the financial commitments in deploying and restocking the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the CPI for inflation has come down to rates near the beginning of the war in recent months.\n\nNow, what we don't see is if these explanations are sufficient to explain most of the shifts in inflation over the past two years. But if inflation was primarily the result of the Biden administration's policy, we would have expected to see certain things in the data, but we see the opposite. First, if too much demand was the main contributor of inflation, we would expect to see potential output, real GDP, or real consumption exceed pre-pandemic projections or trendlines. Where we would expect the big difference is the composition of them have changed.\n\nSecond, we would expect the United States to be globally unique, but instead, we see inflation increasing across the globe. All of the 40 countries the OECD collects data on saw higher core inflation across 2022 than in 2019. Of those 40, 28 of those 40 had higher inflation increases relative to 2019 than the United States. United States' increase in inflation has been lower than many European countries, like the U.K. and Germany, but also lower than countries not in Europe, such as Canada and Israel. Our inflation increase has been about the same as South Korea. This inflation is truly a global phenomenon. Now, our inflation picked up earlier in 2021 than peer countries, driven by price breaks and automobiles particularly, but our reopening growth started earlier and stronger as well. The IMF estimates that the U.S. growth will be twice the average of the Eurozone from 2020 to 2023.\n\nA third thing is instead of seeing people not working, we have seen a rapid recovery in the labor force. Prime age employment to population ratios are near pre-pandemic levels and still growing. There are more workers working today than the CBO projected in 2019 that there would be at this point. Fourth, if unemployment was below a natural rate of unemployment, we expect nominal wages to be increasing and increasing fast. Instead, wages decelerated across 2022 to rates that, while still especially strong, are more consistent with lower inflation.\n\nNow, there has been a lot of progress. Inflation is down almost half across the past three months compared to the first half of 2022 across a variety of metrics, roughly six percent to four percent, depending on what you are looking at. However, inflation is still higher than we want it to be, and there are still policy options we can use to speed its decline.\n\nFirst is to raise or eliminate the debt ceiling. A financial crisis would be devastating to this economy, I don't need to say much more about that. Second is to recognize that a lot of tightening has taken place. Federal Reserve raised interest rates rapidly in 2022, almost five percent, close to the six percent, as the Taylor rule might suggest, and economists agree that these hikes slow the economy in long and variable lags. We don't want to administer too much medicine if we think we haven't seen all the effects of the previous around yet. Measures of housing inflation, in particular, which we know will fall from private sector analysts, take a long time to be incorporated in the official statistics.\n\nThird is to look at corporate profit margins. Non-financial profits as a percent of GDP are at record levels. If corporate profits fall, it means we can have lower inflation while still keeping a strong job market. Fourth, we need to build more. Our infrastructure needs to become more resilient through successful deployment of the Inflation Reduction Act. And also, we need more housing, which was a challenge even before the pandemic. And fifth, we need to expand the labor force from everything, through higher immigration to expanded childcare. There are many job openings available, and this would make our economy stronger.\n\nThank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-13T14:18:25.409562Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:24:39.333890Z","inner_id":9,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":3572,"annotations":[{"id":1267,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"CNffcvPfe-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"VZVLdPCW1L","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Y2PNUyEbzP","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"4twceElIFS","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"4ll00ULXjZ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:24:40.970542Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:24:40.970567Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1.367,"prediction":{},"result_count":5,"unique_id":"5f539a91-9729-4b97-946c-da5a5ffb58af","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":3572,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"1caac6c9-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":10,"text":"Mrs. McClain Thank you very much for all of your testimony and opening statement.\n\nI am going to recognize myself for five minutes.\n\nDr. Holtz-Eakin, yes or no.

And I had the privilege of traveling on our last district work weekend, and I left the country, and I had some conversations about what they were experiencing economically, as well as conversations about how, say, those that threatened not to raise the debt ceiling, which I know we are not here to talk about that. But we have conflated the budget with debt ceiling conversations continually, so I just decided I will go ahead and conflate, continue on with the tradition of this House.\n\nBut in talking to them, I was curious to know, what did inflation look like to you, and surprisingly, it looked a lot like what it looked like here. They talked about supply chain issues as it relates to food. They talked about the war in Ukraine. I will admit that they did not talk about healthcare as much because, you know, in fact, I believe, in your opening statement, you mentioned Europe. Europe actually has universal healthcare. So, when you look at, say, a pandemic, we didn't have as many people that did not have health coverage. And I know about lacking in health coverage because in the great state of Texas, we have over 5 million people that are not covered. That tends to drive costs up when we increased the demand so much on the system that was really already on the brink and we weren't providing coverage, but that is yet another issue for another day.\n\nI know there was just mention about tax cuts, and I will go to you. I am not going to slaughter your name. So, I am going to just go like this, right? So, the Trump tax cuts not only devastated this country's finances with deficits, but it also set the stage for inflation even before the pandemic.

And what is even worse, I think, is that in the district that I represent, that is home to 163,000 retired seniors, 1 in 6 seniors in America are considering returning to work because they can no longer afford the rising cost of living. I think about that. I think about the middle-income Americans on fixed incomes. I think about seniors who are on fixed incomes.

So, this was not the same as March 2020 when the economy was falling at a rate that ultimately contracted by nearly 10 full percentage points in a single quarter, was extraordinary.

Last year, as so many Vermont families like mine saw their grocery bills, their gas bills skyrocket, we know that many American companies were posting record profits. And according to a staff analysis by the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy this past fall, there is clear evidence that shows record price hikes, record profits, profit margins that not only helped to drive inflation, but are also continuing to keep prices high.\n\nSo, from 1979 to 2019, profits contributed to only 11 percent--11 percent--of price growth in the United States, but from the second quarter of 2020 through the end of 2021, profits accounted for roughly 54 percent of price increases. Four of the largest meatpacking companies saw profits increase by 134 percent between 2019 and 2021. The two largest public companies and the rental car industry enjoyed a 597 percent increase in profits. Three of the biggest shipping companies saw profits raise by--wait for it because I couldn't believe it, had to go back and check--nearly 30,000 percent--nearly 30,000 percent. I know that the Vermonters, because Vermonters watch C-SPAN--Vermonters watch this, they are howling at 30,000 percent. It is not in their minds that they are being fleeced. They are absolutely being fleeced. The Subcommittee analysis detailed numerous instances in which companies were using inflation as an excuse to justify jacking up their prices and forcing consumers to pay more to pad their profit margins.\n\nSo, Mr. Konczal, am I pronouncing your name right?

One was the shift from services to goods. I think when you have the kind of supply chain problems we have that ends up with higher prices, it is moderated through prices. I think there is some evidence, or at least there is certainly something worth looking at more formally, about whether or not firms have used the opportunity of this crisis and reopening to raise prices a little bit higher than they would have otherwise.\n\nI think a lot of economists and certainly a lot of financial analysts are a little surprised that the margins, corporations, their profit margins have not declined throughout 2022 and still seem like they might not even decline for quite some time. Even a little bit of a decline in those margins through competition, through proper regulatory scrutiny, would allow inflation to come down while the labor markets still stay strong. I think it is in general, and also, I think it is worth noting that we don't see workers or wages really leading this inflation, like some argue that happened in the 1970's.

These are not necessarily Democrats that are saying this. There are people across the political spectrum who are trying to feed the people in their communities.\n\nAnd so, I wanted to go back to something that I saw. Again, it is really hard to believe some of this stuff. The Subcommittee analysis also found examples of corporate executives essentially admitting to using inflation as a cover for massive price hikes. We had one executive, make sure I get this right, executive from Kroger saying, ``Hey, a little bit of inflation is always good in our business.'' We had another one saying, this one was from industrial sealants, ``We don't reduce prices on the back of these increases. We are going to see what the consumer will bear.'' Other people said that. I could go on and on.\n\nSo, the question to you is when we are trying to convey to our constituents back home why it is that they are still seeing incredible inflation right now, like, how do you articulate for them, regular people, because that is why I ran for office, to show up as a regular person here.

And the demand curve, aggregate demand right here, shows us how much real GDP people are willing to consume at different price levels.

So, I think as we sort of wrap up this, I think, really productive hearing with an amazing all-star, and let me just say, intimidating witness panel. I want to sort of go through what I think are the key takeaways. It doesn't cause inflation to make paid-for investments in working families. If you pay for them, if you take the money out of the economy with taxes, and you put it back in other places, that is allocative, but on aggregate, if you get it right, it shouldn't cause inflation. That is what that curve, that chart was showing. It is a good idea to make wealthy pay their fair share, to pay off the national debt, and help cool inflation. We take some of that surplus tax revenue, we can actually use it to cool inflation.\n\nDemocrats' Inflation Reduction Act, you two didn't agree, but I think it basically met that basic principle of doing those two things: making investments in families and making the wealthy pay their fair share. And the fourth thing is, I don't think, and I really appreciate your honesty, Dr. Holtz-Eakin, there really isn't a secret Republican plan or Democratic plan for that matter, to fight inflation. There is no easy way to do this without punishing hardworking American families, so the solution here isn't to cut spending programs that people rely on. The solution here is to try to support families as we get through this really difficult economic period and let our economy try to find its way back to a level of inflation. That is less painful than where we find each other today. So, I yield back and thank the Chairwoman for her indulgence."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:54:54.263083Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:01.039122Z","inner_id":195,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":4273,"annotations":[{"id":1454,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"4UJtG6f-hN","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"dUhaR3YMCo","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"1qDGW85CEH","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"bIZBAEIKQy","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"MSXWxcww2E","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:05.700361Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:05.700391Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":4.373,"prediction":{},"result_count":5,"unique_id":"ed737aa5-4a0c-4720-aab0-17eb936ff763","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":4273,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"43b6fffe-hearing_copy.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":196,"text":"Mrs. McClain I thank my colleague for her comments, and right now, I will recognize the Ranking Member, Ms. Porter, for her closing statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:54:54.263166Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:05.727391Z","inner_id":196,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":4274,"annotations":[{"id":1455,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"zxD9dySzy1","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"85B02hfBoR","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"fu5BjaQOi2","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"NCAfj1X6bG","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"fMquD3ViIO","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:42.004503Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:42.004527Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:28.607449Z","lead_time":35.998,"prediction":{},"result_count":5,"unique_id":"dd363b32-856e-4225-8f2a-7bfcf9dd1435","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":4274,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"43b6fffe-hearing_copy.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":197,"text":"Ms. Porter Thank you again, Madam Chairwoman, and thank you again, for all of our witnesses.

I am tired of searching for coupons and finding that there aren't any to help me bring down prices. I am deeply invested in trying to rein in inflation for constituents and for my own family.

Inflation is complex. It is multifaceted, and there are certainly tools that government, sometimes Congress, but, as you suggested, often not Congress, can use to try to address inflation. We can keep making our tax code more fair. We can crack down on tax cheats so that we increase tax revenue, can pay down debt, can cool inflation. We can keep fighting corporate monopolies so that our markets can be more competitive and can deliver lower costs. That is really the promise of a capitalist economy. We can keep shoring up supply chains, bringing manufacturing back home, and helping smooth the transport of goods to market. We can invest in long- term structural investments that will do right by our economy, things like infrastructure, things like renewable energy, because these investments pay off in the long run with lower costs for families and a stronger, more stable, more resilient economy that is less vulnerable to inflationary shocks.\n\nIt is possible to do all of these things together, but we can't use inflation as a convenient scapegoat to cut programs that seniors and kids and families rely on. Wherever Committee Republicans land, and I hope the chairwoman will address that, the American people should know that Committee Democrats are going to continue to work tirelessly toward thinking about how to navigate this inflationary period while honoring our commitment to make life better for the American people. I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:54:54.263345Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:42.034043Z","inner_id":197,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":4275,"annotations":[{"id":1456,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"riaXuOqQeD","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"EAR1pdH2CX","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Pjdglhhnwq","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"C6opOhlFUR","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"_g5FFSrlVZ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:07:11.133906Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:07:11.133930Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T19:07:04.802877Z","lead_time":28.735,"prediction":{},"result_count":5,"unique_id":"e2373009-6e8e-419e-8368-e7c10cd7c2af","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":4275,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"43b6fffe-hearing_copy.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":198,"text":"Mrs. McClain Thank you, Ms. Porter, and thank you for conducting my first oversight hearing with me. I appreciate it. I look forward to working with you in the future to come up with some commonsense solutions to help the American people move forward.\n\nI now recognize myself for the closing statements.\n\nI would agree that we are not here to talk about cuts. That is not our plan, but I first feel that we need to start talking about the causes of what got us in this situation. So, we are not going to repeat the same thing over and over again because if we can learn from the past, we can have a brighter future, and I think that is what both sides of the aisle are trying to do for the American people. I can assure you that is what I am trying to do, but we must learn from our mistakes so we are not deemed to repeat them in the future.\n\nToday's hearing has illustrated how important actually facts are over fiction, and we need to stop with the messaging and take a look at the facts. When the pandemic hit in March 2020, inflation was 1.5 percent as compared to the prior year. When Biden took office in January 2021, inflation was at 1.4 percent, compared to the previous year. That is just a fact. On March 11, 2021, Democrats jammed through $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. By April, inflation had risen from 1.4 percent to 4.2 percent. By December, inflation was at seven percent. By June 2022, inflation was at 9.1 percent. The Biden administration and congressional Democrats did not stop there. On August 16, 2022, the $740 billion Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, again, inflation. Too many dollars chasing too few goods.\n\nWe are just doubling down on the American people, yet Democrats have spent this entire hearing denying that inflation exists, claiming inflation is a high-class-only problem and blaming the corporations, who I might add, those corporations pay massive, massive amount of taxes. And what would happen to the taxes if corporations, because there is a third option, the corporations could just stop producing? And then who would pay the massive amount of taxes that the corporations pay because there is another option. We just don't ever want to talk about that.\n\nWe cannot fix a problem of inflation until our colleagues recognize what all hard-working Americans recognize and what we are dealing with, and that is, inflation exists. The truth is Democrats' reckless spending caused the dramatic inflation, hurting millions of Americans. This isn't an opinion, this is a fact, and we need to learn from this fact, to not double down and make the same mistakes again.\n\nThe data clearly illustrates that despite the destructive economic impacts of the pandemic, President Trump had the economy on a rapid path to recovery, 1.4 percent inflation, with his pro-growth and pro-economic policies. Yet Democrats choose to flood the economy with unnecessary--unnecessary-- remember, we passed, we infused money into the economy. We didn't spend it all, and we passed two more policies that put more money into the economy. I mean, we flooded the economy with unnecessary and wasteful spending, causing inflation to spike at a 40-year high and put the economy, I might add, on the brink of recession, no matter how you want to change the definition of a recession. My colleagues across the aisle must acknowledge that it is their inflationary crisis and recognize that Congress needs to immediately address it.\n\nSo, I thank the witnesses for your time. You have been remarkable, all three of you. The wealth of knowledge that you three bring is amazing.\n\nAnd without objection, the Members will have five legislative days to submit materials and to submit additional written questions for the witnesses which will be forwarded to the witnesses for their responses."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:54:54.263471Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:07:11.162688Z","inner_id":198,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":4276,"annotations":[{"id":1457,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Fm4Vh0G8z3","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"QvajDsVUMN","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"wEQhmAnyYA","from_name":"stance-on-topic-3","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"SY6PKOK5Dy","from_name":"stance-on-topic-4","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"jvU9X1Ewyt","from_name":"stance-on-topic-5","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:07:13.636519Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:07:13.636543Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.132,"prediction":{},"result_count":5,"unique_id":"1db4e4a2-c5c1-4c67-9975-5852ead28a4d","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":4276,"project":22,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"43b6fffe-hearing_copy.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":199,"text":"Mrs. McClain If there are no further business, without objection, the Subcommittee stands adjourned.
