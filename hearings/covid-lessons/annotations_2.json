The Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic will come to order.\nI want to welcome everyone here today.\nWithout objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time.\nI now recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement.\nI would like to thank the witnesses for their testimony at the Select Subcommittee's final hearing.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic stands as one of the most devastating crises in our Nation's history. It claimed the lives of millions of Americans, disrupted livelihoods, and took a profound physical, emotional, and economic toll on families and communities across the country.\nSadly, this likely will not be the last pandemic. There will be others that test our Nation's preparedness and resiliency in the future. So, we're here today to look at the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic in order to prepare for and hopefully prevent the next one.\nIn the last 2 years, the Select Subcommittee has sent 118 investigative letters, conducted 38 transcribed interviews, held 25 hearings, and reviewed nearly 1 million pages of documents. The work of the Select Subcommittee revealed serious flaws in the government's response to the pandemic, underscoring the need for reforms.\nWe saw inconsistent, contradictory guidance from the CDC that sowed confusion and diminished trust. Students were out of the classroom and told to attend school remotely even when the science had started to clearly demonstrate it was safe for them to be back in the classroom.\nWe saw Americans pressured to receive a vaccine they were assured that would make them a dead-end for the virus and prevent reinfection and transmission--something that was known to be false based on vaccine trials.\nAnd at the NIH, there was a glaring lack of oversight over Federal grants that posed risk to public health and national security, and millions in taxpayer dollars funded risky gain- of-function research in China. We found nefarious behavior by several federally funded actors--actions that betray the trust of the American citizens.\nWe must learn from these errors, take the lessons to heart, and make fundamental changes. We must establish clearly defined roles, with an overarching structure that empowers agencies to act swiftly and effectively in mitigating the spread of novel viruses, as an example.\nIt is essential for institutions such as NIAID and CDC to execute their assigned missions, functions, and tasks and not stray out of their respective lanes. For example, NIAID is entrusted with vaccine development, while the CDC is tasked with controlling and containing the spread of diseases. Throughout the pandemic, NIAID encroached into CDC's lane by advising on matters pertaining to containing the spread, creating confusion among the American people.\nPoor decisions made by Federal agencies shattered trust in our public-health institutions and left Americans questioning the very leadership that was supposed to protect them.\nDecisions made out of lack of knowledge and data is one thing, but poor decisions must be corrected. To be successful in the next pandemic, our Federal public-health institutions must be accountable to the people again. To be successful, our health organizations must do what they are supposed to do-- protect Americans. Stronger oversight, better accountability, and improved structure within our agencies are essential.\nCongress must consider a dedicated authority to oversee agency practices, ensuring that agencies act solely within their areas of statutory responsibilities and subject-matter expertise and insisting that public-health decisions are transparent, consistent, and credible.\nLet today's hearing be a step toward lasting reforms that will protect future generations from similar crises. I want to thank you, and I look forward to a strong on-topic discussion today.\nI would now like to recognize Ranking Member Ruiz for the purpose of making an opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.017275Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:33:07.427926Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1599,"annotations":[{"id":802,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"Gn3THo99El","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"ntjzdXV23Y","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:34:27.814417Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:34:27.814446Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T16:15:49.764632Z","lead_time":36.001999999999995,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"37674c4e-4a2e-4de4-b488-f2613d91b82e","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1599,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":2,"text":"Dr. Ruiz Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\nWhen COVID-19 hit our shores in the early months of 2020, our Nation began one of the most challenging chapters in its history. We entered a period marked by uncertainty, fear, and a staggering loss of life.\nAnd in those initial months, we, as Members of Congress and as a Nation, overcame our differences and came together to protect and provide relief through the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the CARES Act for the American people in the face of this novel threat.\nSince that time, thanks to the life-saving impact of vaccines and the tireless work of our Nation's scientists and public-health officials, we have turned the page on the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBut during that same period, we have also seen an unsettling rise in mistrust for our Nation's public-health officials and misinformation and disinformation about the very interventions that saved us.\nAs we began the 118th Congress, we had a rare opportunity to take a serious, constructive look at these problems and develop forward-looking solutions to safeguard Americans from current and future threats. And when I became Ranking Member, I stood ready to work with any Member on either side of the aisle who would join me in this objective.\nBut instead of taking steps forward to prevent and prepare our Nation for future pandemics, this Select Subcommittee has spent 2 years fanning the flames of people's mistrust in public health and taking advantage of their fears. And under the Republicans' leadership, the Select Subcommittee pursued vendettas against our Nation's scientists and public-health officials for partisan gain.\nBut whether it was allegations that Dr. Fauci caused and covered up the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic or that our Nation's public-health officials sought to keep schools and businesses closed, more than half a million pages of documents, more than 30 transcribed interviews, and nearly two dozen hearings failed to turn up evidence to substantiate these extreme and baseless claims.\nAnd while the Select Subcommittee's probes did reveal discrete issues of misconduct that must be taken seriously, including by Dr. Peter Daszak and Dr. David Morens, we must ask ourselves whether our efforts over the past 2 years have fulfilled the objective of constructively improving our Nation's ability to prevent and prepare for the future pandemics on the issues that matter most and that would have the most significant impact in those future pandemics.\nLook, since day one, I have said that the Select Subcommittee's mission must be collaborating to develop the forward-looking solutions that leave our Nation better prepared for future novel viruses.\nI have wanted to examine how we close pathways for novel viruses to emerge, be they in nature or in a lab; or to focus on how we can strengthen our schools so that they can be better prepared to maintain safe, in-person learning during future pandemics; to look at how we can build on progress in strengthening infection prevention and control in nursing homes to keep our seniors safe and save lives; to explore how we can lay the groundwork for the rapid development of future vaccines and therapeutics for novel viruses when they inevitably emerge.\nAnd we could've done all these important things, things that have a high impact, significant ability to curb the deaths of the next pandemic or possibly even prevent them--and I've asked for more over the past 2 years--but we didn't. We didn't.\nAnd while we haven't yet come together to tackle these serious challenges--challenges facing Republicans and Democrats alike--I have always looked for opportunities to do so.\nSo, as we begin today's hearing, I want to acknowledge that I welcome its focus, that I wish that we spent more time pursuing this subject with more experts, and I hope that we can commit to a forward-looking discussion about the road ahead. Because, even after 2 years, I still believe that there is a lot more to do, and it's not too late to come together and do the work of saving future lives.\nThank you, and I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.017410Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:34:27.860698Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1600,"annotations":[{"id":460,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"MpSo3nP79e","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"3Z8lUmCX3W","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T17:38:54.031745Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T17:38:54.031776Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":13.285,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"24b591ed-4f2d-4a64-8f80-ebb25d52dd55","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1600,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":3,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Our witnesses today are:"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.017488Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T17:38:54.081038Z","inner_id":3,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1601,"annotations":[{"id":480,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"ZuwCNDRDiv","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"236EH41ig_","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:00:12.776565Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:00:12.776596Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1278.233,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"7a03bd49-b41e-45a7-b93c-109f41a6fad1","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1601,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":4,"text":"Dr. Lawrence Tabak.

We are here today because of our shared belief that taking stock of the lessons learned during the recent pandemic needs to happen sooner rather than later.\nWhile far too many lives were lost, we are proud of the research communities and brave research volunteers who participated in NIH-supported research that delivered a vaccine, diagnostic tests for home use, and a treatment, all in under a year--three remarkable feats.\nIt is fair to say that many thousands of additional people would've died were it not for the public's investment in NIH- supported research. But more work is needed to prepare for future threats, and it is essential to leverage what we've learned from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo maximize our readiness for future pandemics, NIH must better coordinate its key assets, such as research and trial networks, as well as standardize platforms to rapidly evaluate the efficacy of diagnostic tests.\nTo ensure that we can evaluate the broadest range of potential interventions, meaningful collaboration across the USG, industry, academia, and the public must be forged now. Plans must be put into place to assess potential interventions for their value to all communities of our Nation.\nIt is not currently feasible to characterize and develop countermeasures for all circulating viruses around the globe. Therefore, the NIH, led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has developed a pandemic preparedness plan that prioritizes development of medical countermeasures for representative viruses from each of nine virus families.\nThe knowledge gained will not only provide ready potential prevention and treatment strategies for the many different viral variants that could emerge but also the framework for a rapid research and product-development response to other viruses within each family in the event of an outbreak.\nIn addition, by standardizing reagents, models, and data outputs, NIH's coordinated research networks would be able to more easily share results and collaborate quickly to enhance research efforts.\nWe must also continue to invest in the development of methods for detecting transmission of virus that can be deployed in communities equitably and rapidly across the country. NIH is now applying the so-called RADx approach to address a range of health problems, including technologies to reduce the spread of HIV, and developing emergency diagnostics for emerging threats such as avian flu and then the seasonal flu.\nFinally, NIH knows that we cannot tackle emerging infectious diseases on our own, and we are working in partnerships with others to tackle emerging threats across the globe.\nOne example is Marburg virus disease, a severe and often fatal illness in humans clinically very similar to Ebola virus disease. Currently, there are no FDA-approved therapeutics or vaccines available. In September of this year, Rwanda reported cases around their country.\nNIH is working with HHS counterparts and international partners to support research through the ongoing outbreak. NIAID has supported research on candidate therapeutics and vaccines for the disease and has helped make these candidates available in Rwanda to enable patient treatment and vaccination of contacts and healthcare workers.\nNIH remains committed to supporting these efforts and more to advance pandemic preparedness and enhance the international research capacity to respond to infectious disease.\nContinued success in NIH pandemic preparedness and biodefense efforts is contingent upon sustained congressional support. The President's budget request includes $20 billion in mandatory funding for the Public Health and Social Services Fund, of which $2.69 billion will support NIH's work.\nWe appreciate your attention and support for these efforts. NIH will continue to meet the public-health emergency needs by advancing high-priority research of these threats.\nI thank you for your attention and welcome your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.017794Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:09:52.246091Z","inner_id":7,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1605,"annotations":[{"id":511,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"XINr8eD7_P","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"MWmgvXW4lm","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:09:59.986028Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:09:59.986055Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.371,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"a996dd7f-27fa-4822-9ca6-6716343a2bdf","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1605,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":8,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Thank you, Doctor.\nI now recognize Dr. Walke.\nAnd if I mispronounced your name earlier, I apologize."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.017865Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:10:00.037934Z","inner_id":8,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1606,"annotations":[{"id":512,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"ik-YA6gZDX","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Yp12G9hoHP","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:10:03.085205Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:10:03.085234Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.691,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"dc9c4f17-7a94-4d7b-9d4c-3b47b558b389","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1606,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":9,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup.

Chairman Wenstrup, Ranking Member Ruiz, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, it's an honor to be here today.\nI'm Henry Walke, the Director of CDC's Office of Readiness and Response, and I'm here today to discuss how CDC is working every day to protect our health security and save lives by putting science into action to help people and communities prevent, detect, and respond to health threats at home and abroad.\nWe're seeing more infectious-disease threats than ever before, including emerging pathogens like avian influenza; viral hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola and Marburg; mpox; and Oropouche a new illness linked with birth defects.\nAt the same time, many of the leading causes of death and the largest drivers of healthcare costs for Americans are noninfectious diseases such as heart disease, stroke, overdose, and suicide. CDC works in coordination with state and local health departments around the country to provide communities with effective strategies to combat all of these threats. With about 80 percent of our domestic funds going directly to state and local partners, we dedicate ourselves to partnering with communities to protect Americans.\nWe are also in over 60 countries around the world, increasing laboratory capacity and building work force expertise so we can identify and stop pathogens at their source, protecting Americans at home. The relationships CDC builds in other countries means the first call ministries of health make when a health threat arises is often to CDC. It's a matter of national security that we maintain our world-class expertise to be the first to respond.\nThe COVID-19 response showed a number of important successes, but it also exposed challenges and gaps that need to be filled. CDC, in conjunction with outside stakeholders, conducted an extensive review of our processes and organizational structure to document lessons learned and identify corrective actions. As this Committee has heard before, the report identified a number of areas for improvement, including streamlining communication, sharing data faster, and promoting partnerships.\nCDC has implemented over 160 key actions to drive accountability. These changes are seen every day in how CDC operates.\nStarting last respiratory season, CDC now has a public dashboard displaying COVID-19, flu, and RSV information all in one place.\nCDC recently made the first-of-its-kind awards with five private-sector clinical laboratory companies that provide a warm base of support for rapid and efficient distribution of diagnostics.\nAnd we're getting data out faster with the launch of the 1CDP data platform that leverages data reported to CDC from thousands of sources to programs across the entire agency and shares it back in an action-oriented format for Federal, state, and local partners.\nI'm proud of the work we have done, but I have been at CDC long enough now to know that we can't do it alone. One of the core themes identified in moving forward with an effort to improve and modernize the agency was that CDC needed to bolster our core capabilities of data analytics, laboratory capacity, public-health work force, and domestic and global readiness and response.\nStrengthening these core functions would allow CDC to be nimble enough to address any health challenge, but we need the necessary funding and authority from Congress if we want to make the type of lasting change needed to respond to the next pandemic--or, better yet, to prevent it.\nUnfortunately, public-health funding is boosted when there is a crisis, but much of that funding is allowed to lapse during peacetime. We've seen this with H1N1, Ebola, Zika, and now COVID-19.\nThese resources let us create incredible tools that can be used in an emergency but also support situational awareness for other pathogens--for example, our national wastewater system that gives us an early look at how diseases are progressing; or the RREDI platform that supports a response-ready agency to use data to make decisions near-real-time; or our Center for Forecasting Outbreak Analytics that can now show us when and where an emerging threat may go, helping communities best target limited resources; and, more broadly, continuing to modernize our public-health data capabilities.\nWithout increased and sustained resources, these capabilities, which were all largely built with one-time emergency funds, are at risk of going away. Without authorities that let us surge and sustain our work force for the next emerging threat, we'll be back where we started before COVID.\nThe CDC works every day to achieve our mission of protecting your communities from health threats. But we can't be the national-security asset Americans deserve without bipartisan support. I look forward to speaking with you today on the ways that we can enhance our collaboration to protect health and improve lives.\nAnd I'm happy to answer your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.018020Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:15:40.742778Z","inner_id":10,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1608,"annotations":[{"id":524,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"d7_fyfkVpS","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"TW_GRQhPQ0","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:15:43.403794Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:15:43.403825Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.292,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"b1d75d72-f216-499b-a93d-82c44c4a8464","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1608,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":11,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Thank you.\nI now recognize Dr. Marston to give an opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.018091Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:15:43.450721Z","inner_id":11,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1609,"annotations":[{"id":525,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"jHTVHF2UmG","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"hYkzspQxH_","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:18:02.346729Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:18:02.346764Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T18:17:56.381740Z","lead_time":138.522,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"1d4fa7b0-162b-4096-968f-c67a622eba9d","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1609,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":12,"text":"Dr. Marston Thank you so much.\nChair Wenstrup, Ranking Member Ruiz, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the FDA's pandemic preparedness efforts.\nRecent events, whether the COVID-19 pandemic, the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza in dairy cattle, or the emergency-induced supply chain disruptions that we're seeing with Hurricanes Helene and Milton, have all underscored the need to continue to optimize our Nation's preparedness and response capabilities.\nWe know the profound impact that public-health emergencies and our ability to respond to them have on American lives. This can range from how global supply chains affect access to foods and medical products to the value and importance of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics to address those public-health threats, reduce suffering, and ultimately save lives.\nThe additional authorities and funding requested in the Fiscal Year 2025 President's budget are necessary to address future public-health threats effectively.\nSpecifically for FDA, our public-health preparedness priorities are: one, providing greater transparency into supply chains; two, fostering medical countermeasure development; and three, ensuring operational readiness and surge capacity within the agency.\nSo, first, supply chains. We need greater transparency into supply chains to help ensure access to critical medical products. Supply chains are subject to a range of market forces that are well beyond FDA's scope. For example, generic drugs, particularly generic sterile injectables, are most vulnerable to shortage. We know this. But that's due to market dynamics, including competition, investment needs, and uncertain demand-- all dynamics beyond the FDA's scope.\nFDA has worked within its current authorities to find ways to prevent and mitigate medical product shortages. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we've worked with manufacturers to successfully mitigate or prevent 586 drug, biologic, and medical-device shortages. We rely on notifications from manufacturers to help prevent supply disruptions, and we've identified changes that could help the agency better mitigate or prevent shortages.\nSpecifically, FDA seeks authorities to require FDA notification when there's increased demand for a product; require manufacturers to report sources of active pharmaceutical ingredients and the extent of manufacturer reliance on them; require labeling to include the original manufacturer and supply chain information; and require manufacturers to notify FDA about interruptions or discontinuances in medical-device manufacturing outside of public-health emergencies.\nSecond, the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of fostering medical countermeasure development as a preparedness measure.\nThroughout the COVID-19 response, FDA's scientists and employees worked around the clock trying to provide guidance to manufacturers and researchers, minimizing the time between clinical development, manufacturing, scale-up, and regulatory review. This is how FDA was able to help make critical medical countermeasures, especially COVID-19 vaccines, available as quickly as possible based on our stringent scientific and regulatory standards.\nWe're leveraging the lessons learned from the COVID-19 response in our everyday reviews, including reviews of platform technologies and improving communications with manufacturers.\nThird, ensuring operational readiness and surge capacity is critical in emergencies.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw FDA staff pulled away from other work to focus on pandemic work for 3 years, leading to backlogs and fatigue. Creating a specialized program to defend against emerging pathogens and other threats would leave the FDA best positioned to respond to future emergencies and focus experienced staff to work quickly on medical countermeasure development.\nCritical investments are also needed to increase FDA's inspectorate work force capacity to conduct oversight of those products.\nThe key lessons learned and proposals I'll discuss today will bridge key gaps to enable a robust and timely response to future emergencies. They'll help enhance early detection; provide safe, effective, and accessible medical products; and maintain health system capacity.\nWe look forward to continuing to work with Congress to improve public-health preparedness. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to your questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.018176Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:18:02.396133Z","inner_id":12,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1610,"annotations":[{"id":526,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"TOhqCwQRNx","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"hvZLFr3GeM","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:19:33.440595Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:19:33.440625Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T18:19:19.773585Z","lead_time":90.668,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"a1024624-9431-4e56-8e36-8caff9e5e2f0","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1610,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":13,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Thank you.\nI now recognize myself for questions, but I do want to take a moment to thank you all again for being here.\nAnd I would tell you, I appreciate your constructive reforms that you talk about, actions that have been taken since the pandemic response, the idea of solutions, and honest self- reflection that we all need to undergo if we are going to do better in the future.

They are not a new problem, but they certainly were laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlso, it's important to recognize what's causing these shortages. And the primary causes of the shortages, the long- term causes, are these weaknesses in the markets, right?\nThese generic sterile injectables in particular, not everybody can make them. They need to be sterile; that's an important thing. You know this as a physician. They can't be made everywhere. And they require additional upkeep of those lines, additional care, the ability to have buffer stocks. All of these things cost money, and unfortunately the profit margins are very razor-thin.\nThat is quite clearly beyond the mission of the FDA, but it is something where we are often trying to work on the fallout from those issues. So, one of the things that we've been doing is trying to partner across government for solutions that can address those market-based issues.\nBut for the FDA in particular, there are some things that we can do to improve our ability to provide and mitigate shortages.\nFirst, we really need to be able to know when there is a rise in demand that these companies can't keep up with. So, currently, they are required to tell us if a line goes down and they can't keep up with supply. But if there's a spike in demand, for example, as we saw with the children's analgesics a couple of years ago, they don't need to tell us about that. So that sets us back in our ability to mitigate.\nSecond, they don't need to specify their reliance on different manufacturers for active pharmaceutical ingredients. They don't need to put those things on their label. So, we have proposals that would address both of those and require that.\nAnd, third, medical-device manufacturers actually aren't required to tell us about any supply disruptions outside of a public-health emergency. So, if a tornado takes out your factory, which unfortunately is a painfully real example, you're not required to tell the FDA. We might call you, we might see it in the news, but it's not a requirement.

We have made sure that our advisory committees are airing the data that they're seeing, that we're putting out summaries of our views, of our own analysis of the data that's provided by manufacturers. We do our own analysis, right? We don't just take things that are given to us. Our professionals look into the data themselves.\nSecond, we have certainly learned a lesson and we have taken this lesson across the FDA for various medical countermeasures: the importance of telescoping to industry what our expectations are going to be, what sort of information that they're going to need to provide to us. So, we do that in the form of guidance, and we've done it in vaccines several times, therapeutics, and diagnostics.\nThird is this issue of surge capacity. Our folks are incredibly dedicated, and they worked around the clock. As I mentioned, that's led to backlogs, it's led to fatigue.

And there were a lot of lessons learned, and there's a lot that we should be thinking about.\nAnd this is an area that I've spent my six terms in Congress thinking about, pre-pandemic. You know, my staff would, early on, often wonder, like, why are you spending so much time thinking about this? I'd say, ``Go watch 'Contagion.' '' And then, unfortunately, you know, we lived it. That wasn't the hope.\nYou know, post-Ebola, we put in some things in place, you know, in terms of having someone who was in charge of pandemic preparedness at the NSC looking around, programs like the PREDICT program that, you know, would be out there. And I visited those folks in Sierra Leone to see what we were doing to try to have early warning systems and do disease surveillance.\nA lot of that was dismantled in the first Trump Administration, and we sounded the alarms that it would make us vulnerable. I'm glad that we've put some of that back.\nYou know, early in the winter of 2020, we sounded the alarms when we saw what was going on. We had the first hearing in Congress about this novel coronavirus and understood it was something different.\nWe've now spent the better part of 4 years talking about COVID origins. I don't think we will ever get to the bottom of that, because the evidence was probably destroyed. And, you know, it was unfortunate we weren't able to get to the hot zone immediately in early 2020.\nI would urge us, as Congress and the country, to just accept both as plausible theories, so we can--you know, if it is a lab leak, let's actually raise lab standards. Let's have the ability--if folks are doing gain-of-function research and other research that is absolutely necessary for preparedness, let's make sure they're adhering to the highest of lab standards.\nWe also know that viruses occur naturally and there are naturally occurring pathogens. We should do everything we can to, you know, try to prepare for that, and I think it's time for us to move on.\nYou know, we have to better understand, with a novel virus and a pandemic and a very fluid situation where new information was coming in, how we get that information, how do we communicate it to the public. Because what we knew in March 2020 was very different than what we knew in October 2020.\nAnd, again, in a fluid situation where people are scared, we should spend time thinking about how we allow the scientists to be the scientists, how we allow the politicians to be the politicians, but not have the politicians try to be the scientists and the scientists try to be the politicians. How do we work together to communicate that, again, to a scared public.\nYou know, Dr. Marston, you talked about the critical vulnerabilities in our supply chain. Those clearly were exposed. We, as Congress, should do everything we can, with the rest of the world, to address those critical shortages, think about what that looks like, and, you know, fairly quickly, where it makes sense, on APIs, on protective equipment, et cetera, you know, make sure we've got adequate stockpiles but we've also got the reserve capacity to flex up very quickly.\nEarly on, I was involved in lots of conversations that talked about various strategies of--you know, we knew older patients were more vulnerable. You know, perhaps this did not seem to be impacting younger folks as quickly as possible, given the devastation we were seeing in New York. We made broad decisions which I think made sense at that juncture, but as we gained more information, we should've fed that back into strategies.\nYou know, I totally understand why in the spring of 2020 we closed schools. Was that the right decision in the fall of 2020? You know, we've got a perfect ability to--different states did different things. We should go back and learn from that and feed that into the future so, if we're faced with the same dilemma, we have that information.\nI still have plenty of questions about why, as this virus evolved--you know, it came up through the East Coast, through Italy, into New York, devastated New York. We had the first naturally occurring case at my home institution, UC Davis, but it didn't rip through California. You know, I would've expected to see really bad results in Japan--densely populated area, they're a little bit more open, an older population. Why did the virus impact different countries differently? It didn't rip through India, which, you know, we were incredibly worried about.\nI would hope that we, in an objective way, as a scientific community, taking politics out of this, could go back and try to understand the epidemiology. Was it that Japanese culture is a mask-wearing culture, et cetera.\nSo, you know, there are plenty of questions that still remain outstanding. If we could allow the scientists and the academics to address those things, I would hope that we, as Congress, could fund those studies, understand it, not to prosecute anyone or anything else but to actually better prepare ourselves as a country and the world.\nYou know, our public-health systems I knew had atrophied. We had very bad disease surveillance systems. Obviously, we've stood up wastewater surveillance and other measures. We could do better, though, to protect our public.\nAnd it is not just naturally occurring pathogens. The Chairman and I sit on the Intelligence Committee and we talk about, you know, the vulnerabilities of bad actors, of bio threats, et cetera. We ought to, as a Congress, in a nonpartisan way, learn from the past but better prepare ourselves for the future.\nThere were real successes as well. You know, I never would've expected that we would get a vaccine--several vaccines that were safe and efficacious within 12 months. We did it. Some of that was because of prior investments in research at the NIH and elsewhere. Can we get that from 12 months to 3 months?\nCan we--the FDA successfully streamlined processes to get biotherapeutics to market. What are lessons learned there?

I would like to take a moment to thank Dr. Wenstrup and his staff for their incredible leadership throughout this Congress on investigating and evaluating the Federal Government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUnder his direction, we have held key agencies and witnesses accountable for their actions made during the pandemic, fulfilling the Oversight and Accountability Committee's mission to provide a check and balance on the role and power of Washington, and a voice to the people it serves.\nI'm really proud of the work that we have done, and I look forward to another productive hearing. And, most importantly, the majority of us on this Committee understood that our mission was, in fact, to prepare for the next pandemic. And so, what has been brought up by Dr. Wenstrup and Dr. Bera is precisely that. I spent 24 years in the military, as well as a practicing nurse, doctor, former director of the Iowa Department of Public Health. And, if we don't look back on what we did and do an after-action report, we don't know how to buildupon what has gone before, what our errors were.\nDr. Walke, you are the director of the Office of the Readiness and Response at the CDC where you support the agency's effort to improve performance for public health emergencies. And, as you likely know, as I just stated, I was the director of the Department of Public Health, and I was a practicing physician prior--before, after, and then prior to coming to Congress.\nAnd I thank Dr. Bera for his comments about origins. Yes, we spent a lot of time on origins. But, even in 2020 as a freshman Congressperson when the media and social media was trying to portray this as a witch hunt, and it was useless, my comments in 2021 are the same as they are today. It was necessary to investigate origins because that's how we prepare for the next pandemic.\nWe need to discuss immediate disclosure, which the Chinese Community Party did not do and are required to do under international law. We need to discuss lab safety, what type of laboratory research occurs and what lab environments, and that it's in the correct lab environment. And, No. 3, we need to discuss the ethics of certain types of research, i.e., gain-of- function research. So that's why those were important issues.\nAnd, you know, my next question is going along this line on how people were treated who engaged in conversations, not conformity of thought. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I administered vaccines to Iowans in all 24 counties in my district but never supported any sort of vaccine mandate or vaccine passport. And that's because I'm a physician first.\nI was and still am critical of the CDC's messaging surrounding vaccines during the pandemic, largely because it inserted itself between the doctor-patient relationship, and it discouraged patients from asking questions. It downplayed and, in fact, refuted that there was infection-acquired immunity and herd immunity. People were labeled as antivaxxers, radicals, and called other demeaning terms simply for questioning whether novel vaccines that had not been FDA approved were right for them; or if they needed to be vaccinated if they'd already had proven disease and immunity; or if, because of their age--and we saw two of the expert--vaccine experts at the FDA resign over the FDA's position.\nSo, as a result, we have seen increased rate of vaccine hesitancy, which could have a detrimental impact on public health, especially as we're entering flu season. In most of my district, for example, rates of vaccine hesitancy are already at 15 percent. And, as a state senator in 2019 and 2020, I can tell you there were numerous bills entered and discussed about prohibiting vaccines.\nSo, do you believe that the CDC's, I'll call it forceful, to be diplomatic, guidance on COVID-19 vaccines, and lack of detailed information on possible adverse outcomes, like when they downplayed that there was myocarditis in young men, that it's contributed to the increasing rates of vaccine hesitancy?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.029880Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:52:17.621012Z","inner_id":84,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1682,"annotations":[{"id":645,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Dq1-b2zXX3","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"nTr5OIWaMl","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:52:26.373412Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:52:26.373442Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":8.362,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"fd2ca86d-bdb3-41b8-8a75-93d998992493","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1682,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":85,"text":"Dr. Walke Thank you for the question.

So, the truth of the matter is that we worked quite closely with the CDC on these matters. And the most important lesson, I think, that we have learned is to show our work and explain our work.\nFor example, when we see a safety signal in something like VAERS, we're going to look in our multiple systems to see if that actually is something that is plausibly related to the vaccine. Where then, we then have multiple cases, taking those analyses and put them into the published literature, we also present them at advisory committees.\nI think one of the things that we are also looking at is that that's not good enough, right? So that reaches a certain group of people. The people who are regularly reading the medical literature, for example. We need to take it a step further, right, and communicate those things on multiple levels so that they're easy to understand.\nSo, one of the things that we've been doing is working with the clinician community, trying to make sure that they're armed digestible information that they can then relate at their patients. Because, you know, people might not be listening to the Federal Government, the public health agencies. I hope that they will. But we also want to make sure that we're meeting people where they are. And, if that's with their local clinician with their physician, with their nurse, we want to give those people the info they need."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.030872Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:58:50.505688Z","inner_id":98,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1696,"annotations":[{"id":659,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"JlnR4PngXC","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"U7tTMm-kuN","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:58:55.147831Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:58:55.147862Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":4.273,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"8b0f32fb-3cd9-4096-b636-6c9548c7dd9a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1696,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":99,"text":"Mr. Mfume Thank you.

Thank you to our witnesses. I want to thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee for all of their work. And, obviously, oftentimes Members on this body and Committee disagree. I think it's important to recognize we lost 1.3 million Americans due to the pandemic, our single largest loss of life event that we've had in the modern era. There's over 3,000 people in my own city of Long Beach died while I was the mayor right before I got to Congress. Horrific experience to see what the pandemic did for cities and communities across the country and, of course, the world.\nI want to note a couple of things as this is our closing. This Committee, I think, one is--I'm hoping that there's two critical changes that I think are really important on the Federal level, bills that I've been working on. I want to note this for all of you. I am very concerned that still the Department of Health and Human Services does not have the same emergency buying power the Department of Defense has.\nWhen we went through the pandemic, much of the purchasing of PPE and testing went through DOD because they have emergency power to purchase in bulk and purchase and kind of cut the red tape. That power does not exist for Health and Human Services, where I personally and many others believe is where those purchases and where that direction should be coming. It should be coming HHS, not from DOD. At least it should have the same purchasing power. So that's something that we're working on. We have a bill on that.\nThe second issue I want to note for Members of the Committee is we have to get to a point where we fully fund the CDC's National Wastewater Surveillance System. I can't express how important this is in preventing future pandemics. This is woefully underfunded. And we have a huge opportunity to allow and provide the CDC the resources they need to ensure that we are using this incredible resource now and being able to track viruses and pandemics to the future, and they were funding this at its full level, and not actually cutting the CDC and this program. So those are things that are very concerning to me.\nAnd I want to say one other thing which I think is important, my last opportunity. Dr. Tabak, I know you're with the NIH. And I just wanted you to just briefly mention what the NIH's responsibility is to prevent pandemics that this Committee is working on?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.032083Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:05:50.830775Z","inner_id":115,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1713,"annotations":[{"id":677,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"BzxYzXf-nq","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"w1eaWhAvvo","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:11.094872Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:11.094901Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T19:06:10.924009Z","lead_time":19.891,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"715c388c-7521-4cbd-9f1f-af4fe5d74390","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1713,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":116,"text":"Dr. Tabak So, we support and conduct the research that informs the actions of my colleagues on this panel.

Together you all represent the bulk of the government's response to COVID, or you represent the agencies that were bulk of the response. And the American people are very concerned about the government's response, you know. There was a lot of understanding in the first couple of weeks that this was novel, and we had to figure it out. But, once the outbreak kept going, we saw attempts to cover up failures. We saw blatantly politicized policymaking. We saw Americans getting deceptive advice while their civil liberties were being trampled on. Federal public health agencies promoted school closures that caused long-term learning loss and mental health problems. Forced mask mandates on toddlers in the face of all scientific evidence to the contrary. Threatening Americans with the loss of their livelihood. Their businesses were closed if they declined new--any experimental vaccine. Along with many, many, many other grievances that the people would have in the response that we had.\nNow, we got together on Tuesday just so the Chairman can let us know that this hearing was going to happen, and someone asked the question and said, ``What do you think the lessons learned are going to be in the testimony?'' And I kind of jokingly replied, ``Well, I'm guessing like every other agency that makes a mistake or has failures in the Federal Government, they'll probably come and same, 'Well, we need more money and more authorities.' '' And that's by and large what the testimony was today. And I'm not saying those discussions don't need to happen at some point. I mean, it would be very suitable for the Appropriations Committee. But what we didn't see was an answer to these questions that remain outstanding for the American people. And, in an effort to rebuild trust, it's very important that we answer these questions.\nDr. Tabak, I wanted ask you one of the things that we--that came up in much of our testimony--Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins both indicated to this Committee that, even though their signatures appear on every grant, basically the process is that you have people researching the grants, right, at a lower level, and basically they put it before a committee or a peer- review committee that receives a priority score. Then it goes to an advisory council. And then it goes to--at the time it was Dr. Fauci, for example, when we were talking about the NIH grant.\nNow, this is one of many cases. I've seen this in agency after agency after agency. These are supposed to be multiple levers of accountability. And what happens is Dr. Fauci, for example, said, ``Well, yes, my name's on it, but, you know, I don't have time to read every grant.'' And that's kind of understandable. Well, then who is responsible for it? Well, it's this Committee. Well, this Committee votes on it. Like block grants to the tune of even sometimes a hundred grants at the same time. They don't actually read it either.\nAnd so, we end up having these supposed multiple layers of accountability that turn into multiple layers of plausible deniability. So, nobody ends up being held to account. And so, when we're talking about lessons learned, these are the kind of systemic things within agencies that I would like to hear: What are we doing to fix these things? What are we doing to make sure that we don't tread on people's civil rights again? What are we doing to make sure that we don't threaten the licenses of medical professionals who are experts in the field that might have a different view?\nThese are the kind of things that I'm wondering, how are we going to make sure that the government stays in check so that we can begin to restore the trust in the American people?\nCan you speak to the grants system, and has anything been done about that? Because I brought this up in several Committee hearings since then."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.036453Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:08:53.594038Z","inner_id":122,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1720,"annotations":[{"id":686,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"XdqJnq7xuL","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"UC4_7zUvN9","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:09:01.958652Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:09:01.958684Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.91,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"f4fe5735-0264-4ea5-92dd-8568b9479814","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1720,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":123,"text":"Dr. Tabak So, again, you described the way grants are reviewed."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.036523Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:09:02.008487Z","inner_id":123,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1721,"annotations":[{"id":687,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"SC_p_nDYbY","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"7gsDRuDASM","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:09:53.972454Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:09:53.972483Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T19:09:24.433222Z","lead_time":51.361,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"874841ba-d9e7-4f1b-99b8-6126d7ead1c7","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1721,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":124,"text":"Mr. Cloud That's my point, though.

And I urge my House Republican colleagues who have spoken in favor of public health and pandemic readiness today to stand against the dangerous agenda and support critically needed investments, not cuts, in pandemic preparedness.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.037849Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:17:43.141961Z","inner_id":141,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1739,"annotations":[{"id":710,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"B7CCSXGMHI","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"qTtzpS7mNd","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:17:46.694617Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:17:46.694647Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.192,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"7cf5f7b6-6e31-4620-9bf9-0dbeae5c2848","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1739,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":142,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup I now recognize Dr. Joyce from Pennsylvania for 5 minutes of questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.037916Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:17:46.746389Z","inner_id":142,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1740,"annotations":[{"id":711,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"p__QzaFG13","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"-zMGHO6bn7","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:18:33.555406Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:18:33.555434Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":46.203,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"c9c2d060-7fe3-4c28-8ba8-ec5b8d729fff","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1740,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":143,"text":"Dr. Joyce Thank you, Chairman Wenstrup, and Dr. Ruiz, Ranking Member, for convening this important hearing and to our witnesses for testifying.\nDuring this Committee's investigation of the Federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become abundantly clear that throughout the pandemic, many decisions and many statements made by public health officials were not based on science.

While public health emergencies can trigger critical supplemental funding for agencies, the funding structure is not conducive to preventing future pandemics.\nFor example, CDC jump-started an innovative wastewater surveillance program during the pandemic through the use of emergency supplemental funds. Once this funding dries up, the agency will no longer have the resources to continue this program. We must ensure that tools like this are fixtures of our public health strategy rather than waiting for emergent situations to implement them.\nAnother key area that the CDC has focused on is improving our disease testing infrastructure. To enhance these efforts, Congress must act to improve the supply of medical laboratory personnel, a profession that played an indispensable role during the worse days of the pandemic and is currently facing a serious work force shortage.\nI proudly introduced, and Dr. Bera has joined me in it, the Medical Laboratory Personnel Shortage Relief Act of 2024, which would do just that. It's clear that Congress can take steps to complement the tremendous efforts made by our public health agencies to ensure that we're ready for the next pandemic.\nThank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.044044Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:26:11.016624Z","inner_id":177,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1775,"annotations":[{"id":757,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"5zNtfhkYLK","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Ww2obzBEOq","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:26:14.347031Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:26:14.347062Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.956,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"2f9af7aa-ced1-459c-934d-c48bec68ca76","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1775,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":178,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Thank you.\nI now recognize Ms. Greene from Georgia for 5 minutes of questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.044125Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:26:14.397018Z","inner_id":178,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1776,"annotations":[{"id":759,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"GZ48qvXWM9","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"jPGG2KdtVF","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:26:41.244411Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:26:41.244440Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":26.468,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"52dd66d7-8dc2-4739-96a2-72b16ac9588a","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1776,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":179,"text":"Ms. Greene Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This Committee hearing today is titled ``Preparing for the Next Pandemic: Lessons Learned and the Path Forward.''\nI think one of the greatest lessons that has been learned here is the government and its powerful agencies should never use the American people's hard-earned tax dollars to create viruses that can be unleashed on the world like COVID-19 was. This led to killing millions of people all over the world.\nCOVID-19 was funded using the gain of function in a bio lab in China, and then it was lied about. Dr. Fauci lied to the American people, abusing his power and position and role, very powerful role paid for by the American tax people. He lied, and many, many people died. Not only that, schools were shut down. People's jobs were shut down. Employment was ended. Small businesses were shut down. Life as everyone knew it was shut down. This caused violations of people's First Amendment rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion. People couldn't even go to the beach.\nThen suicides hit record highs. And the saddest thing is there were record suicide rates seen among children and a mental health crisis released on Americans like never before.\nNow there's massive delays in education and loss of learning. What was absolutely repulsive is the forced masking requirements of children. Children were not at risk of being hospitalized or dying from COVID-19, yet children became one of the worst victims of the malpractice and abuse of power by your agencies and by people in charge in many cities, states, and the government. It was absolutely horrendous.\nBut then there were doctors that came out with treatments using ivermectin, zinc, vitamin D, and it was labeled horse paste. And those doctors were attacked and criticized and called conspiracy theorists. Yet, while those doctors were actually saving lives, these other patients were being forced into the hospital, put on respirators, and were actually dying.\nMy own personal doctor never lost one single patient by prescribing ivermectin and this other protocol. As a matter of fact, he saved people's lives. Thank God he did that.\nThe CDC even changed the definition of ``vaccine.'' The FDA approved an experimental vaccine through a rushed approval process that suppressed trials and data that showed that vaccines didn't work and had side effects that even caused death.\nFifteen pages of known side effects the FDA wanted sealed for 75 years. What were they hiding and lying about to the American people? Well, we know now.\nVaccines have been mandated on the population in order to work, go to school, and live as functioning citizens in the United States. Yet people who reported vaccine injuries and deaths on the VAERS system were ignored; they were mocked; they were called conspiracy theorists; and they were canceled on social media when they tried to tell about the horrifying things that were happening to them or their family members.\nThe White House even accused the unvaccinated of killing people, calling it a pandemic of the unvaccinated. And they said we'll bring a winter of death for yourselves, families, and hospitals.\nBut guess what? Vaccines didn't work. And those that were vaccinated, boosted, continued to catch COVID. Our own President, President Biden even tested positive for COVID-19 after this summer's Presidential debate. That is unbelievable. And I can tell you, when you talk about vaccine hesitancy, as one sitting before you that never took the COVID vaccine, nor will I take it--thank God--I'm so glad I didn't take it--yes, this vaccine hesitancy has risen to new heights. And I can tell you right now, I'll stand here and represent all the Americans that do not ever want to be forced to take another vaccine that the government is telling us to take after they created a deadly virus. I can tell you right now, I'll also represent all the Americans that never want their children to be forced to be vaccinated.\nCurrently, right now, the CDC is recommending the children as young as 6 months have two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine or three doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. So, vaccine manufacturers continue to make billions and billions of dollars on a vaccine that doesn't work being forced on children, innocent children that don't even need it because they aren't at risk of being hospitalized or dying from this vaccine.\nNot only that, vaccines need to be investigated further. The rise of autism, learning disabilities, neurological problems, and so much more that children are suffering from today absolutely is being forced upon these children and their families because of these vaccines.\nThis Committee should have investigated the vaccines, and it was a failure to not do so. This has literally been a war on the American people's health, the world's health, but also a war on our children's health. It's a war that has been waged on them by our government, Big Pharma, who's making all the money.\nPreparing for the next pandemic is actually recognizing that the last pandemic resulted in crimes against humanity. People that perpetuated and continue to perpetuate these crimes need to be prosecuted. And that needs to be starting in the next administration. And I'm pretty sure our next Attorney General will do that. And I look forward to seeing that happen.\nMr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of my time."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.044212Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:26:41.293033Z","inner_id":179,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1777,"annotations":[{"id":760,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"57Fu5sBeOi","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"-ENrIB2LK2","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:26:44.667971Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:26:44.667999Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.001,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"2271d445-8338-4619-b400-f8f104e6c29b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1777,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":180,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup I now recognize Dr. McCormick from Georgia for 5 minutes of questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.044283Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:26:44.715723Z","inner_id":180,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1778,"annotations":[{"id":765,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Mw8M7lqjwW","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"cGNAHkifu8","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:27:22.618823Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:27:22.618852Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":37.448,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"e3f3bafc-869c-4195-99d8-9405ffc4aed4","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1778,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":181,"text":"Dr. McCormick Thank you, Mr. Chair.

OK Thank you, both of you.\nYou know, as an ER doc who basically got exposed to a deadly virus, saw patients who were sick, watched patients die, watched the science evolve, and watched my fellow physicians get criticized the whole time by people who were not treating people, that hurt me a lot. And I think it really decreased the credibility of people who call themselves scientists, who didn't even have science at the time; they had guesses. And they were guessing and outmaneuvering the physicians who were treating the patients and doing their very best.\nI'll tell you a few things that I learned as somebody who lived through this from the physician\/treatment side.\nFirst of all, the CDC gave blanket recommendations that were not scientific at times, quite frankly. Because we didn't have science; we didn't know. But they still gave recommendations that superseded what doctors could do. And it made people either not trust their doctors or not trust the CDC. You had to choose sides then. That's wrong. It became-- instead of scientific, it became politically driven, in my opinion.\nI also think that we fell very short in accountability and transparency at the NIH. I think the way we do our grant system, and the way that we're trying to come up with the right answers according to who protects NIH rather than who protects the people, in my opinion, based on the relevant evidence that we've received while we're here.\nBut, mostly, as in any crisis--doesn't matter if it's banking, housing, climate change, or disease--we should be hesitant to turn to government for the answers. Bureaucrats and politicians are not experts and should never be allowed to infringe upon our inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\nEven when it's scary, we have the right to self-determine. We, as Americans, must always protect freedom, whether that be in our protecting of ourselves, which has consequences of possibly income or travel, or also allowing people to pursue education, transportation, or the best interests of their business even if that requires risking their own health or income. That is America. That is the promise, not of security, but of opportunity that exists nowhere else in the world.\nYour discussion should be with your doctor, not intruded upon by the government that thinks they know better than both the doctor and the patient.\nWe saw how easy it is for the government to take away our rights, to make our lives miserable, if we don't comply, so that, as Dr. Fauci said, ``We lose our ideological bullshit,'' quote, in order to get the favor of a government that is ruling instead of serving. That's what I've learned.\nInstead of turning to government for the answers, we allow people to determine with their healthcare professionals what is best. And, by the way, we may not agree, and that's OK. The government should never determine who's right and wrong. Science, experience, and treatments determine what ends up being right and wrong, and it's a learning process that should never be intruded by the government.\nWith that, sir, I yield. God bless you. Thank you for this Committee. And let's go forth and do great things."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.045076Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:29:58.026792Z","inner_id":191,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1789,"annotations":[{"id":779,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"FoLndpD7iI","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"6c478Lc77K","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:30:20.751076Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:30:20.751105Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":22.319,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"c9bdc609-d62e-4114-806b-006742e05599","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1789,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":192,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup I thank the gentleman.

It is very important that we keep front and center and remember them always.\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, it gripped our Nation with uncertainty. We knew little about this novel virus, about the way it spread, the danger it posed, and the damage it would inflict on our communities. But it was during this time of significant uncertainty when one thing became increasingly clear: Our Nation was not where it needed to be when it came to pandemic preparedness and response.\nBut with rapid and sustained deployment of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics and robust public health investments in the American Rescue Plan, we left the darkest days of the pandemic behind us.\nThis is thanks in large part to the dedicated and hardworking members of our Nation's health agencies. I want to offer my thanks again to our witnesses here today representing some of those agencies and sharing with us the tireless work they are doing to prevent and prepare for the next pandemic.\nI want to make it very clear to the scientists, who never wanted to delve into politics, who went pre-med and not political science; I want to send a message to the lab technicians that work in your agencies; I want to send a message to the administrators who, day-in and day-out, want to do the right thing for the mission that your agencies pose; I want to say thank you. You are not the enemy, and you should never be demonized. Your work is valuable. Your work is appreciated. And your work is what is keeping our country safe.\nAnd there will be help, and there will be recognition of that work, and there will be a positive way forward from this. So hang tight, buckle up, believe in your work. Know you that are appreciated by millions of people in this country, regardless of the demonizations and the disinformation that's out there and the misinformation that's out there. You're doing good work. So, I want to thank you.\nAnd know that--keep your integrity, keep your character, and do the right thing. We have seen and investigated individuals here that veered from doing the right thing, and that is not acceptable. So, what you're doing in doing the right thing, being transparent and open, is what's going to help us through to the next pandemic.\nSo--and that is why--this is thanks, what we've been able to accomplish, in large part to the dedicated and hardworking members of our Nation's health agencies. And I want to offer my thanks again to our witnesses here today representing some of those agencies and sharing with us the tireless work that they are doing to prevent and prepare for the next pandemic.\nLast Congress, Democrats led the House in taking meaningful steps toward bolstering our pandemic preparedness and response capabilities with passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023.\nIncluded in this law were bipartisan provisions from the PREVENT Pandemics Act, which made several significant reforms to help ensure we are better prepared when a future pandemic strikes. These reforms acted to advance our Nation's biosafety and biosecurity, revitalize our public-health work force, prevent undue foreign influence in biomedical research, and enhance our Strategic National Stockpile.\nWe didn't focus on these during these last 2 years. We didn't really have a conversation about the positive work that has resulted from that--from these laws from last Congress and how they're being implemented. We didn't dive into the positive things that we learned from the lessons learned.\nSo, I just really want to highlight them there, that there is a whole other section of actual work that's being done. And there still needs to be oversight, there still needs to be collaboration, there still needs to be a discussion of all those changes so that we can make sure it moves in that right direction and, in fact, that we keep them, given all the recent threats that we've heard today.\nBecause, ultimately, these policies have charted the course of a more efficient, streamlined pandemic response for the future, and they have shown what we can do when we come together constructively to protect Americans' health and save lives. And we must work to continue these efforts to strengthen our supply chains, develop new vaccines, and stay on the cutting edge with advanced therapeutics.\nAs an emergency physician and a public health expert, developing forward-looking solutions that help our Nation better prevent and prepare for future public-health crises continues to be my top priority.\nSo, I hope that today's hearing serves as a reminder of the important work that our Federal health agencies do for the American public--it's imperfect, but it's important, and the results have shown for itself, since we are no longer in the throes of this pandemic--and that Congress will continue to support this work, rather than manufacturing distrust or throwing conspiratorial accusations in our safety systems and public health as a whole.\nAnd before I end, I know we'll have another session, but I'm going to take advantage here and thank this hell of a guy, Miles Lichtman, the director on the Democratic staff team, Alicia Yass, Dani Walker, and Joseph Romero, who have done incredible work, who I'm extremely proud of, who have only made me a better person and a better leader and have done extremely, extremely important work for the American people. And I want to thank you all individually.\nAnd I also want to thank the Republican staff. I have seen firsthand the dedication during some of our travels and work that we've done. I know your heart's in the right place. Thank you.\nI yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.045233Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:30:58.828902Z","inner_id":193,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1791,"annotations":[{"id":784,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"8IQAUKCg0K","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"s3ffoiNdrj","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:31:50.781528Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:31:50.781557Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T19:31:36.179736Z","lead_time":51.562,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"f4678cbd-0edd-4564-8018-11dd4349dbf2","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1791,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":194,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Thank you, Dr. Ruiz.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank our panelists once again for your important and insightful testimony here today. I thought this was a very good hearing.\nI would like to thank you, Dr. Walke, Dr. Marston, Dr. Tabak, for coming here today to testify at this final hearing of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic. We greatly appreciate your insight, and hope that we all will continue to work on improving our future pandemic response and that we continue to learn from our past shortcomings.\nI had several reasons for not running for office again. Amongst them, when I was given this responsibility, was, I wanted it to be seen that I am not here on a political purpose or a political mission. I'm a physician. Truth matters. Lessons learned matters. All of those things come into play. Nothing about chairing this Subcommittee had political gain for me. But I did want to serve the American people and be able to take this after-action review and get our lessons learned.\nUnfortunately, throughout some of this, some things became political, unfortunately. Some people had self-interests over that of all of mankind. And we discovered that, and we worked our way through that.\nAnd we will have a product for the American people to absorb and for we as a government to absorb on how we can go about doing our business and how we can protect the American people more and save lives and be the leader in the world when it comes to being able to respond appropriately so that others may benefit from mistakes we made, that we may benefit from mistakes we made, and, also, it's a time to applaud some of the things we did right, which are many, through this whole process.\nI want to thank also staff on both sides. Thank you. Thank you all. There's been a lot of hard work put in this in the last 2 years.\nSome things we found, not so good. Some things we found, very good. And we should build on those things. We should build on those things.\nPolitics has no place in taking care of people. That's the bottom line. To me, we can do better, and we're going to propose to do better, and try to create the environment where we can do better.\nThe next pandemic will happen, maybe not in our lifetime, but let's be better prepared. There's a lot of logistics. America can lead the way. We can lead the way. We've got too many good people to not lead the way.\nSo, there's been a lot of reflection today, and, you know, I want to go down the line, starting with you, Dr. Tabak, and ask that each of you will commit in the next 2 weeks, if you would, to provide this Select Subcommittee your top two lessons learned through this and how we can work together to overcome these issues.\nYou're nodding your head?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.045311Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:31:50.832101Z","inner_id":194,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1792,"annotations":[{"id":785,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Xq5AC1Bcyk","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"J3XGDDeWDT","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:31:53.334981Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:31:53.335010Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.08,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"7027399e-e0cb-4fad-9397-dcd8a4ba0ab6","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1792,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":195,"text":"Dr.

Anyway But, you know, while today was the last hearing of this Select Subcommittee, our work is not yet complete. The Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic will be releasing its final report in the coming weeks, and in this report we can continue our commitment to transparency. We'll release our findings on the investigations that we have so thoroughly examined during the past 2 years.\nIn addition to our findings, we'll include recommendations for future pandemics based on the lessons learned. It would be irresponsible for us not to do that. It's not enough to highlight what went wrong, or terribly wrong, but if we do not work to find ways to fix it for the future and have a better process, then we have wasted our time. And I don't think any one of us here--people that run for office, people that serve the American people, you do not want to waste your time.\nI look forward to releasing our final report. Hope that our work, which has been extensive, as you know, will be used to prevent, predict, prepare, and protect us from the future pandemic, which were my words at the very beginning.\nThank you all.\nWith that, and without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days within which to submit materials and to submit additional written questions for the witnesses, which will be forwarded to the witnesses for their response."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.045805Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:32:46.753233Z","inner_id":201,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1799,"annotations":[{"id":795,"completed_by":3,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"mbA1X6C6rO","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"E1Eb7sM04L","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:32:50.149611Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:32:50.149643Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.025,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"bb88e94b-87f6-466a-a5a3-48b820058b16","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1799,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"f957f430-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":202,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup If there is no further business, without objection, the Select Subcommittee stands adjourned."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T16:45:14.045875Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T19:32:50.198764Z","inner_id":202,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":12,"updated_by":3,"comment_authors":[]}]
