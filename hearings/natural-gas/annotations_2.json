I will admit I could not believe it happened when it did, and if it was a pause of a week or two, maybe that could be something that would be digestible. The fact that it has gone on now for months is something that is very perplexing, and this is the reason for the hearing.\n\nIn doing so, however, the Administration is undermining our country's national security and energy independence. The Administration, along with leftist activist organizations, have made it abundantly clear that they wish to end all fossil fuel use and reach Net Zero emissions by 2050 at any cost. This effort would be laughable, except that it is eviscerating our economy and hurting hardworking Americans across the country. In fact, the left's policies have consistently ignored the energy benefits, jobs, revenues, investments, and educational opportunities that come with LNG facilities across the United States.\n\nIn 2019, America officially became a net exporter of energy and now leads the world in LNG exports. I found it interesting that in my home state of Texas, we actually produce more natural gas than the entire country of China. We take great pride, and we should take great pride, in the fact that we are an exporter and that we have states like Texas that can outperform and outproduce large nation-states like China. However, this Administration's pause has caused a great alarm and uncertainty, particularly with our European allies.\n\nThe United States' LNG producers and exporters are rightfully alarmed by the pause. They need predictability in order to move forward into the future. In fact, 16 states' attorney generals [sic] have now sued the Department of Energy, arguing that the DOE did not have clear congressional authorization to issue a pause and violated major questions of doctrine when they did. State-level representatives in Texas have gone as far as to create a House Select Committee on Protecting Texas LNG Exports to mitigate the negative consequences of the pause on the LNG industry and the state energy sector as well. It is going to affect the Texas economy as well as the United States economy, and I commend them for these efforts.\n\nOne key issue with this LNG pause is understanding the Federal Government's legal authority to make the decision. It is unclear whether the pause is even necessary to update the public interest analysis the Department seeks to update. When acting on an LNG export permit application to a non-free trade agreement country, the Department conducts a public interest analysis that takes a number of criteria into account. Many, including several of us in Congress, question whether the Department and the Biden Administration should have applied those same criteria to their decision to pause LNG exports. Had they applied those criteria, it seems the Administration would have easily decided against an LNG export pause.\n\nYou have to ask yourself, what was the domestic need for the pause. What would be the effect on job creation? What were the international considerations, and what would be the pause's effect on the environment, which it is purportedly intended to benefit? If the Biden Administration was truly considering environmental impacts of LNG exports, it would have dismissed the role LNG plays in the world's energy mix.\n\nLNG produces 40 percent less carbon dioxide than coal and 30 percent less than oil, which solidifies LNG as the cleanest fossil fuel in the mix. The Biden Administration and the Department have defended the pause by arguing that our operational capacity for LNG exports remains at high levels. True, but for how long because we are talking about moving forward and what is going to happen in the mid and near future. Americans do not need to read between the lines to understand that this pause is a political decision in an election year to shore up an election base.\n\nOur witness, Brad Crabtree from the Department of Energy, leads the Department's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management. His office has been tasked to assist in the review and update to the public interest the analysis for LNG exports. I want to thank Mr. Crabtree for appearing here today and for your willingness to testify on this important issue.\n\nOne thing to also consider, when you have a war between Ukraine and Russia, this is an absolute gift to Vladimir Putin insomuch as one of the main destinations for liquified LNG exports is Europe, and allies desperately need it, and I do not want them buying it from Russia.\n\nAnd with that, I yield to the Ranking Member, well, now it is going to be acting Ranking Member, Ms. Norton from Washington, DC, for her opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T13:21:59.985747Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T13:20:37.390523Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":616,"annotations":[{"id":1495,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"g-6GLM4M8_","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T13:21:11.731392Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T13:21:11.731426Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":25.349,"prediction":{},"result_count":1,"unique_id":"a7d96f51-8e98-45c1-ad38-4e4b3d031b44","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":616,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"728bd21d-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":2,"text":"Ms. Norton Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Fallon, and thank you to the witness for being with us here today.\n\nAs a matter of good government, I have always held that Congress should use the most up-to-date facts and analysis when crafting policy. I would expect Federal agencies to do the same. Members of Congress should encourage agencies to study issues before making consequential policy choices. Outdated data leads to outdated policy.\n\nBack in January, when the Department of Energy paused future permits for liquified natural gas, or LNG, export terminals, they did so with the goal of making better policy. DOE is taking the opportunity to update its public interest analysis to include current economic climate change and global energy security considerations. Over the last 5 years, global events and new research have shifted the economic and environmental factors that DOE should consider when making LNG export facility permitting determinations. DOE must also closely scrutinize the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the LNG production lifecycle and its disproportionate effect on minority communities.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has wisely pumped the brakes or new permits to examine all potential effects on the American people. This temporary and limited pause on permits will in no way affect our ability to assist allies across the globe. To help defund Vladimir Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine, the United States has stopped export capacity to meet the European allies' energy needs. DOE has already approved permits to supply enough LNG to support Europe, with capacity to spare.\n\nNew research indicates that producing LNG emits more greenhouse gases than previously estimated. Natural gas system leaks spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. New satellite measurements reveal that prior estimates fell woefully short of understanding the scope of LNG production's environmental impact. Previous analysis also failed to account for the disproportionate damage LNG export projects have on disadvantaged communities. These export projects emit toxic gases that can increase cancer and lung disease risks. Yet corporations, focused solely on profits, keep building new export sites near low-income and minority communities. I applaud DOE's work to take a moment to update their research related to these projects.\n\nAs part of President's Justice 40 Initiative, these studies must focus on decreasing the energy and environmental burden on disadvantaged communities. The Biden-Harris Administration has not chosen to stymie industry. It seeks simply to carve a policy path forward using up-to-date research and evidence. Using science and facts is not anti-energy. It is pro-people, pro-communities, and just commonsense.\n\nThis hearing makes a mountain hill out of a molehill. The permitting pause affects only export projects awaiting approval by DOE. DOE has already authorized permits for facilities that, when operational, will amount to a 600-percent increase in LNG capacity. Moreover, DOE leadership does not expect this pause to last more than a year. We are all here today talking about a drop in the LNG export budget bucket compared to the massive expansion in export capacity the Biden Administration has already enabled. This whole endeavor is just one more chapter in the Majority's false claim that the Biden-Harris Administration is waging some sort of ``war on energy.''\n\nI once again return to the facts, which show that the United States has never produced more fossil oils than right now. LNG export capacity has increased more than 30 percent since 2021. More importantly, this Administration and congressional Democrats have made historic investments in clean energy through the Inflation Reduction Act, which will reduce energy costs for American families, invest in a healthier future, and combat climate change by bringing us closer to a 100 percent renewable energy future. I follow the facts and listen to experts. The Biden-Harris Administration has committed to do the same.\n\nThe natural gas permitting pause is just that, a pause to gather more evidence to make sure our policies are the right ones. I do not understand why some of my colleagues object to evidence-based policymaking. Maybe they would rather have this hearing than working with the Administration to move beyond harmful fossil fuels, like LNG, and support policies that embrace renewable energy sources.

Sorry I thought I pushed it.\n\nGood morning, Chairman Fallon, Ranking Member Norton, Congressman Higgins. I appreciate the opportunity to be before you today and to testify at today's hearing regarding the Department of Energy's announcement of updates to our economic and environmental analyses that support public interest determinations for liquified natural gas export applications to countries with which we do not have free trade agreements. We are required under Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act to undertake such determinations. I look forward to sharing some background on that announcement and a status update of where we are today.\n\nLet me begin with the unprecedented transformation brought about by U.S. natural gas production. In less than 2 decades, the shale revolution has fundamentally changed America's energy prospects. We have gone from a Nation poised to become a major natural gas importer to the world's top producer and exporter of natural gas, both of which are relatively new roles for our country. Over the past 2 years, American natural gas has made a decisive difference in helping Europe to meet its energy supply challenges following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as the broader energy security needs of our Asian and other international allies and partners.\n\nLast year, U.S. LNG exports reached a new high, averaging nearly 12 billion cubic feet per day, and exports are expected to increase to over 14 billion cubic feet next year as new projects come online. With authorized projects currently under construction, our export capacity is set to reach over 26 billion cubic feet per day. That is more than double our current level, and our export capacity will be 40 percent greater than any other country by 2030, even after accounting for other countries' announced capacity additions. And our level of authorized exports to countries in which we have no qualifying free trade agreement goes well beyond these numbers. We have authorized exports over 48 billion cubic feet per day to non-FTA countries. This is 4 times our actual current LNG export levels and nearly twice the anticipated export volumes at the end of this decade. This level of authorized exports to non-FTA countries represents nearly 45 percent of our current domestic natural gas production.\n\nTo summarize, our export posture is world leading and will grow dramatically during the remainder of this decade, regardless of future DOE export approvals. This context makes clear why it is so important that we take this moment to evaluate the impacts of authorizing further exports beyond the very large volume of exports that we have already approved. We need to understand how additional exports beyond 48 billion cubic feet per day--again, nearly half our domestic production--would impact our economy, communities, domestic consumers, and manufacturers, international partners, and the environment. To that end, on Friday, January 26, DOE announced that we are undertaking a review of our analyses that we rely on for public interest determinations of applications for proposed exports, again, to non-FTA countries. While this update to our analysis is being completed, DOE will defer making determinations on all pending non-FTA applications.\n\nRegular updates to economic and environmental analyses have long been a critical component of DOE's public interest determinations under the Natural Gas Act, Section 3(a), and in the past, we have also deferred decisions on those determinations pending completion of analyses. In 2012, DOE temporarily deferred its review of 15 then-pending applications to export LNG until it completed its review of public comments, which occurred several months later in 2013. Two years later, in 2014, DOE announced plans to undertake new economic studies to gain a better understanding how even higher levels of U.S. LNG exports, at levels between 12 and 20 billion cubic feet of natural gas, would affect the public interest. Those studies were then published in late 2015.\n\nBy early 2018, DOE again determined that a new economic study was warranted, given both the total volume of non-FTA exports authorized at that time, again, equivalent to 21.35 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, and the additional volumes of LNG requested for export in then pending applications. Accordingly, 6 years ago, in June 2018, DOE published its fifth and most recent economic study, entitled, ``Macroeconomic Outcomes of Market-Determined Levels of U.S. LNG Exports.'' DOE provided notice of all of these economic studies in the Federal Register and solicited public comment. These public comment processes have been an invaluable part of our decisionmaking.\n\nAdditionally, beginning in 2014, DOE undertook studies to evaluate lifecycle greenhouse gas and other environmental impacts associated with LNG exports. The established framework for making public interest determinations relies on economic and environmental analyses to inform DOE of the potential impacts of additional exports. As we explained in an order denying a petition for rulemaking brought by several environmental groups last summer, ``because the U.S. LNG market and related issues, including climate change considerations and global energy security, are all dynamic, the LNG export program is best served by continuing to update the economic environmental studies, analytic approaches, and public interest factors that DOE considers in an iterative fashion based on developing facts and circumstances.'' Our current economic and environmental analysis is consistent with last summer's order.\n\nTo carry this out, we are partnering with two of our national laboratories, the National Energy Technology Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, to support the underlying modeling work, which is well underway. This effort will be similar to past updates. However, one key difference is that when those past updates were undertaken, the reality of U.S. LNG exports was speculative or, at best, nascent. Now, after several years of burgeoning U.S. natural gas production exports, we have significant data and global events and trends to draw on. We are working quickly to complete this work and to have it ready for public comment. We are planning for a 60-day public comment period, and together with that process, we estimate the update will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2025.\n\nI would note in conclusion, we have a strong record of defending our Natural Gas Act determinations because they have relied on well-supported and up-to-date analyses.

Mr. Crabtree, we appreciate you being here today, sir.\n\nYou realize, of course, that the actions that you have taken on behalf of the executive for whom you work, it is impacting thousands and thousands of American lives and jobs. You can speak to the amount of LNG export that has been maintained, and you can dangle those numbers before the American people, but that is growth of the industry that was created by the industry and an appetite from the world for clean, reliable, affordable energy.\n\nSo, my district in South Louisiana has become, over the course of a very quick couple of decades, the epicenter of LNG export for the entire country. And we feed clean, affordable, reliable energy to the entire world, primarily before the interruptions from this executive branch, many of which were led by you, or at least you are at the point of that spear that you are being forced to wield. Prior to the executive's interference, the American LNG industry had been feeding reliable, affordable clean energy to our allies across the world, and because of various interruptions that have been planned and calculated, interruptions to American energy production and dominance and export, our European allies have had to rely on other sources for their raw energy product to power their grids across the continent.\n\nAnd now you have, Iran is selling 90 percent of its raw energy product to China. That means China is feeding Iran billions and billions of dollars. Russia is deeply engaged in renewed energy supply across Europe because the reliability of that supply chain has been crippled by Biden Administration policy decisions. And, my brother, Mr. Crabtree, you are a part of this, man. We do not understand what happened between the summer of last year and January of this year. My colleagues are going to get into that.\n\nThe timeline that you put forth in your advisement of the pause sounds very cool. We are just going to chill for a little while we take a closer look for a few months. But you knew that a pause that you were initiating generally requires over a year to renew normal permitting. Is that correct? Historically, doesn't it take over a year? Didn't you say in this hearing, a little while ago, next year?

We have economic and environmental analysis that we are required to use in our decisions of determining whether a given export application is in the public interest. And over the course of the program, beginning in 2012, on a periodic basis, we have had to update the economic and environmental analysis, subject to changing circumstances in the marketplace. In the initial years, those analyses and, frankly, the industry itself were suggesting much lower levels of exports than we are actually already at today, let alone what we have approved for the future. And so, our process now is consistent with what we have done in the past. Our last environmental analysis was updated 5 years ago. Our economic analysis was updated 6 years ago. Based on previous practice, it is time for us to update that analysis.\n\nA lot has changed in the world. We are the largest producer and exporter of natural gas in the world.

We have heard in this hearing today the United States has grown to be the world leader in liquified natural gas exports in less than a decade. The Department of Energy has already permitted more than 50 billion cubic feet of LNG export capacity. That total of new export capacity eclipses the United States' daily energy use. As I showed earlier, the Biden Administration has paused only a small fraction of possible permits. The Administration paused new permits to perform a long-overdue update of public interest studies that currently do not reflect reality.\n\nUpdating the Nation's permitting policies based on modern information and data is just good government. The world has changed in the last 5 years. Russia invaded Ukraine, leading Europe to end all LNG purchases from Vladimir Putin, leaving them searching for new sources of natural gas. The United states seized this opportunity to help our allies hurt Vladimir Putin and rise from fourth in natural gas exports globally to first in just a few years. At that time, American exporters doubled their capacity.\n\nAt the same time, the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act supercharged domestic green energy production. The Biden Administration has America on a clean energy path that allows us to move forward from fossil fuels like LNG. In the meantime, DOE must update its LNG export public interest analysis to account for the detrimental impacts on the communities that house LNG export locations. Previous assessments overlooked the disproportionate impact on underserved communities and ignored critical questions of environmental justice. I commend the Biden-Harris Administration's actions to right these historical wrongs.\n\nThis hearing boils down to a made-up war on energy and an attack on evidence-based policymaking. President Biden and congressional Democrats have charted a path to renewable, affordable energy for all Americans.

I just want to correct the record. Since 2012, the pause that occurred then, and before the studies were complete in 2014 and 2015, the DOE actually issued seven conditional projects. The precedent appears clear to me. And also, we rose to prominence in historical high production levels in the 10-year period where there were zero LNG export bans. And I will say once again, the production levels today are determined by policies and decisions from years ago. The industry wants stability and predictability.\n\nI talked with former Secretary of state Mike Pompeo, and I found something that he said very interesting, that when he was talking to other diplomats, heads of state, et cetera, and his counterparts around the world, that he had a lot more pliancy and flexibility when he was negotiating things that were unrelated to energy because of the production levels that occurred during the Trump Administration, and because these nation-states wanted, needed, need what we have an abundance of.\n\nThe Biden Administration is simply unserious about energy independence, and I do think there is a war on energy. You can ask the energy industry, and I did not come to Congress, despite what one of my colleagues said, to do the bidding of anyone other than the American people and certainly not the energy sector. I want the free markets to reign, and I found it very interesting as well that, apparently, Joe Biden can prevent natural disasters. I was unaware of that, so that is very interesting. And I do think there is a war on American energy, though, and it is very clear. You can ask the energy industry, and you can see what President Biden did on day one, was canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline and emptying our Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\nWe had a hearing on that, on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and how it is essentially--I do not know what the exact number is as it is now updated--but it is about half of what it was when he came into office. That is absolutely inexcusable, particularly when Mr. Crabtree talked about precedent. The precedent was, when we were drawing down the Strategic Reserve, we were drawing it down sometimes 10 million barrels here, 20 million here, right after a natural disaster, or I think it was the incursion in Libya. We have never drawn it down 200, 300, 350 million barrels ever, and that just happened before a midterm election, so, that is inexcusable.\n\nAnd I do think that the ban on liquified natural gas exports is also inexcusable because when you have capital- intensive industries and projects, they need reliability, they need stability, they need predictability. They are risking a lot. When they invest that money, there is no guarantee that there is going to be a return, and we all use the energy that they produce. I found it also interesting that at a State of the Union address, the President of the United States said we may need--may need--fossil fuels 10 years from now. I find that remarkable. I think we are definitely going to need them moving forward.\n\nThe Department says that because the U.S. leads the world in LNG exports, it needs to update its public interest analysis for LNG permitting, and that requires a pause in permitting. It does not require a pause. You can do both. Again, you can do it at the same time. The update to the analysis will include new studies on LNG's climate impact. After the pause's announcement, White House national climate advisor, she could not even answer questions when asked about the amount of greenhouse gas emissions that this pause would cut in the short term. And there is a good reason to think it will not reduce emissions at all, and I sure as hell think it is not going to prevent any natural disasters.\n\nYou know, listen to what 10 of my democratic colleagues wrote President Biden on February 1, 2024, urging him to support U.S. LNG exports, and this is a quote: ``If U.S. LNG replaced international coal use by 2030, it would have the equivalent climate impact of electrifying every vehicle in the United States, installing rooftop solar on every U.S. home, and doubling our current wind capacity.'' That is some bipartisan commonsense. They also wrote, ``Every molecule of US LNG exported helps limit the growth of global emissions.''\n\nWhy then is the Biden Administration willing to say goodbye to one of the most important tools in the tool shed for reducing emissions? The liquified natural gas pause sends the wrong message to the world, as do other clearly political decisions against U.S. energy interests. I think, again, for the record, we should note that this pause, this ban, will only be lifted after the November elections this year. We have heard testimony today explaining how the pause is not affecting domestic price adversely, and how the operational capacity of our LNG exports remains at high levels. What these numbers do not indicate are the market conditions for new LNG facilities and LNG exports which, ultimately, impact prices and our ability to export. LNG is a global commodity. The prices fluctuate based on markets. It is just more coincidental that domestic prices have gone down slightly in the last 3 months. What these numbers do not indicate are market conditions for new LNG facilities and LNG exports, which, ultimately, again, impact the prices and our ability to export.\n\nAnd to quote, again, one of my Democratic colleagues on February 1 in the letter to President Biden, ``It is time to dispel the false narrative that U.S. LNG exports have an impact on domestic prices.'' Another quote: ``Despite record high LNG exports, U.S. natural gas prices have collapsed since February 2022.'' So let us be clear. United States' LNG exports have not had any sustained and significant direct impact on natural gas prices domestically. Exports of LNG have the potential to add $73 billion to the U.S. economy and create thousands of, as my colleague, Mr. Higgins said, well-paying jobs. This is economics 101, and really, it is kind of free market for dummies in which the Department of Energy needs to have a lesson in.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia is laughing in our faces. Think about who was pleased by this ban or pause. I think Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin was very happy with it. You know, newspapers in Russia are writing ``now it is not Russia but the United States that wants to bring Germans to their knees by denying new American LNG export potential.'' Many European Parliament members have expressed regret and concern over the pause in the announcement that came in January. They wrote, ``The decision not to allow permits to proceed undermines America's allies and the Western order more broadly and will give succor to our adversaries and those who wish to divide us. We should reconsider.''\n\nI would like to submit for the record the European Parliament letter and House Democrats' February 1, 2024 letter to President Biden in the record.\n\nWithout objection, so ordered.\n\nThe question becomes, if it is not the U.S. supplying affordable and clean and abundant energy to the world, who is going to do it? I think some nefarious actors are going to be very pleased. Our allies around the world are relying on us. We need to provide leadership. We have what not only they want, but what they need, and we need to provide consistent energy supplies at affordable prices. Instead, this Administration has chosen to intentionally create uncertainty within the markets at a time when global tensions are growing increasingly high, particularly considering what is happening in the Middle East right now. America is uniquely situated to provide the world with affordable energy, and it is a blessing, and, you know, we should not hinder our own energy security. The rest of the world will be watching closely the decisions that we make here in Washington, and we urge the Department of Energy to reevaluate and reverse this misguided decision.\n\nI want to thank our witness for coming today, and with that, this Committee hearing is adjourned.\n\nNope. Nope. One minute.\n\nAnd with that, and without objection, all Members have 5 legislative days within which to submit materials and additional written questions for the witnesses, which will be forwarded to the witnesses."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T13:22:00.020392Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T14:13:43.505806Z","inner_id":226,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":841,"annotations":[{"id":1720,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"2Mji4yklAA","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-18T14:13:49.064801Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T14:13:49.064833Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":4.081,"prediction":{},"result_count":1,"unique_id":"8b5fff30-5720-4d99-9855-374ad2e3d95f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":841,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"728bd21d-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":227,"text":"Mr. Fallon If there are no further business, without objection, the Subcommittee stands adjourned."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-16T13:22:00.020469Z","updated_at":"2025-06-18T14:13:49.114501Z","inner_id":227,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":5,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
