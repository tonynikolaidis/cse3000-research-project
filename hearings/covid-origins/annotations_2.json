The Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic will come to order. I want to welcome everyone who's here today, as well as our witnesses. Without objection, the Chair may declare a recess at any time. Pursuant to rule 7(d) of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and at the discretion of Chairman Comer, Mr. Jordan, a member of the full committee, may participate in today's hearing for the purposes of questions. I now recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement.\n\nWelcome to our first of many hearings concerning the coronavirus pandemic. We are tasked to review all the effects of the pandemic, as well as decisions made during the pandemic, not just the origins of COVID-19. However, we are here today at our first hearing to ask the fundamental question that this body has failed to ask three years ago: Where did COVID-19 come from? Did it come from a natural spillover, transferred from a bat to an intermediate source to human? In other words, did it come from nature? Or was it the result of a laboratory or research-related accident? In other words, did it come from a lab?\n\nThis question is fundamental to helping us predict and prevent future pandemics, protecting our health and national security, and preparing the United States for the future. This question is not one that should be dismissed out of hand. It cannot be taken lightly. It must be investigated thoroughly, responsibly, and honestly, an investigation based on facts, expert opinions, and without intentional or unintentional bias.\n\nThat is what the Select Subcommittee is tasked to do; follow the facts, conduct a fair investigation, and seek to deliver the truth to the American people. Ultimately, we will strive to produce a product that will serve future generations, enhancing our capabilities and operating procedures when we are faced with the threat of another pandemic. That is what is deserved. That is what Americans should expect from their government, and this is one more way we can provide for our defense.\n\nThe work has already begun. Thus far, the Select Subcommittee has sent letters of inquiry to the Department of Health and Human Services, the White House, and Dr. Francis Collins of the National Institute of Health, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former Director of National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Chief Medical Advisor to the President; EcoHealth Alliance, recipient of NIH funding grants to perform coronavirus research, the Department of Energy, Department of State, and the FBI, concerning their intelligence and investigations surrounding the evolution of COVID-19 and any forensic findings they may have discovered.\n\nOver the weekend, we released a memo highlighting new evidence that suggests that Dr. Fauci prompted the drafting of a publication that would disprove the lab leak theory, that the author skewed evidence to achieve that goal, and that the current chief scientist of the World Health Organization was an uncredited coauthor even though he appears to have contributed to the piece entitled, ``Proximal Origins.''\n\nI think we've already established that the Select Subcommittee will try to leave no stone unturned to try to find the truth. Unfortunately, the question of the origins has been politicized. That's no secret. It has driven most people to their corners rather than driving apolitical scientific debate or discussion. Some say the virus came from nature that, according to recent papers discussed in New York Times, the science is dispositive.\n\nSome say it's too unique, too primed for human transmission, that there's too much circumstantial evidence that points to COVID-19 coming from a lab. As well, in three years, there's been no track found to prove that COVID-19 evolved naturally from an animal or a mammal or a tick to become highly infectious to humans. The truth is we don't know the origins of COVID-19 yet for sure. We don't have a smoking gun.\n\nFirst, the science behind COVID-19: the genome of COVID-19 is inconsistent with expectations, and is unique for its group of viruses. COVID-19 has both a binding domain optimized for human cells, and a furin cleavage site, or a small part of the virus that makes it so infectious. That has never been seen before in a SARS-related virus. In other words, COVID-19 has unique characteristics that made it very infectious to humans. These have never been seen before in any other viruses of its type.\n\nMost viral outbreaks are slow and small. CDC data shows SARS infected approximately 8,000 people worldwide, and eight in the U.S. Similar with MERS, which infected approximately 2,000 people worldwide. But COVID-19 was primed for human transmission. It has infected more than 750 million people worldwide. Dr. Redfield, one of our witnesses here today and a virologist, has even said that he believes COVID-19 had a detour from nature to be educated how to infect humans.\n\nSecond, the known research occurring in China: We know the Wuhan Institute of Virology was conducting gain-of-function research on novel bat coronaviruses by creating chimeric viruses, combining two viruses together to test infectivity and infecting mice with these viruses, work that former COVID-19 task force coordinator, Dr. Deborah Birx confirmed was, in fact, gain-of-function, contrary to statements by Dr. Fauci. We have learned that the Wuhan Institute has poor biosafety and was conducting this research at only Biosafety Level 2, described as the ``Wild West'' by Dr. Jeremy Farrar, a virologist from the U.K., now Chief Scientist for the WHO.\n\nWe have learned through a leaked DARPA grant application that with U.S. taxpayer backing, the Wuhan Institute proposed inserting furin cleavage sites into novel coronaviruses, the same unique genetic aspect of COVID-19. And we know, according to a State Department fact sheet, the multiple researchers at the Wuhan Institute were sick with COVID-19-like symptoms in the fall of 2019, before the Chinese officially announced the outbreak.\n\nThird, concerning the actions of NIH and EcoHealth Alliance, records show that the National Institutes of Health while the U.S. was under a moratorium on gain-of-function research, exempted EcoHealth Alliance and the Wuhan Institute from this very ban. Records show that the National Institutes of Health allowed EcoHealth to conduct risky research on novel coronaviruses at the Wuhan Institute without going through the potential pandemic pathogen department level review board. Records show that EcoHealth violated Federal grant policy, and failed to file its five-year progress report for more than two years.\n\nRecords show that EcoHealth violated the terms of its grant and failed to report an experiment that resulted in gain-of- function of a coronavirus at the Wuhan Institute.\n\nFourth, for some reason that we do not yet know, leaders in the scientific community took action to attempt to convince the world that they should not take the lab leak theory seriously. Dr. Francis Collins stated he was more concerned with harm to ``international harmony'' than he was with investigating the lab leak. Dr. Fauci said the lab leak theory was a ``shiny object that will go away in time.''\n\nThe president of EcoHealth, Dr. Peter Daszak orchestrated a letter in The Lancet that called the lab leak a ``conspiracy theory,'' a statement that directly benefited Dr. Daszak himself. And four scientists, after a conference call with Dr. Fauci, completely reversed their position. Dr. Kristian Andersen said he found ``the genome inconsistent with evolutionary theory.'' And Dr. Robert Garry said he ``really can't think of a possible natural scenario.'' But a few days later, published a paper saying the exact opposite, a paper based on the new emails we released claim to be prompted by Dr. Fauci himself.\n\nFifth, the intelligence: FBI Director, Christopher Wray, confirmed publicly that the FBI assessed COVID-19 most likely originated from a lab incident in Wuhan. The Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Energy now also believes a lab leak is the most likely origin. These aren't run-of-the- mill agencies. The FBI used experts in biological threats and is reportedly supported by the National Bioforensic Analysis Center and the Department of Energy used its own Z Division, experts in investigating biological threats. These are some of the facts as we know them, but there's so much more to do. We are here today to try and understand what and why.\n\nIt's important to conduct this investigation. Discovering the origins is vital. It matters for the future of the world, and we aren't finished. We're just beginning. There will be more hearings and more inquiries and more documents discovered, and we will follow every lead. I look forward to hearing from our expert witnesses today, and I thank them for joining us today. Thank you.\n\nI would now like to recognize Ranking Member Ruiz for the purpose of making an opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.977374Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T15:54:15.790773Z","inner_id":1,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1801,"annotations":[{"id":281,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"e6WylV6JPv","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"WCwawBx5OP","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T15:57:59.444191Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T15:57:59.444220Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":223.094,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"5aa4856a-d58b-42a9-9e5c-4c699c49a83c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1801,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":2,"text":"Dr. Ruiz Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\nToday, the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic convenes for its first hearing to discuss the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, an issue of vital importance to our Nation's public health. Since the first outbreak of COVID-19, researchers in the scientific community have worked tirelessly to evaluate the virus and advance our understanding of its origins. Dozens of studies have been conducted, or are currently underway, to evaluate this question. And under President Biden's direction and leadership, the intelligence community initiated a sweeping assessment to get to the bottom of the virus' origins.\n\nThe facts are the evidence remains inconclusive. Therefore, we must allow our scientists and intelligence communities to gather evidence without politicization, extreme partisan rhetoric, or conspiratorial accusations that vilify our Nation's public health experts.\n\nInstead, we should focus on developing policies that prevent and reduce the harm of future viruses and pandemics. As Ranking Member of this select subcommittee, it is my sincere hope that we can conduct this work in an objective, bipartisan way, based on evidence to save lives.\n\nHowever, today's hearing marks a concerning step down the path of letting extremism get in the way of an inquiry that should be led by science and facts. When House Republicans announced this hearing with their slate of handpicked witnesses, I was alarmed to see someone who wrote a book applauded by white supremacists. Mr. Nicholas Wade's 2014 book, ``A Troublesome Inheritance,'' suggests that different racial and ethnic groups have evolved to possess genetic variations and traits and behaviors tied to whether they prosper or not.\n\nFor example, Mr. Wade speculates that certain populations have evolved to develop greater innate intelligence. He writes that quote, ``Intelligence can be more highly rewarded in modern societies because it is in far greater demand,'' end quote, and conversely, he claims that certain populations have been slower to experience an evolutionary change he has described as quote, ``the transformation of a population's social traits from the violent, short-term, impulsive behavior typical of many hunter, gatherer, and Tribal societies into, quote, `the more disciplined future oriented behavior observed in other populations.'&quot;\n\nThe notion that people of different racial or ethnic groups are more successful or intellectually superior to another because of predisposed genetic makeup is grossly inconsistent with the consensus of scientific and medical scholarship. That is why I sent a letter to my Republican colleagues this morning strongly urging them to disinvite Mr. Wade as a witness so as not to give legitimacy to a man of such discredited, unscientific, and harmful views.\n\nThese views are dangerous and have no place in a hearing examining the origins of a pandemic that has disproportionally and overwhelmingly harmed communities of color in the United States. I'm concerned that Mr. Wade and his views have been elevated by his participation on today's panel, giving him a platform reaching millions of Americans. His participation hurts the credibility of this hearing. Answering the question of how the novel coronavirus came to be one that should be driven by the need for thoughtful policy solutions. Whether the novel coronavirus emerged naturally or as a result of a lab leak does not change this.\n\nAnd as our expert communities work to advance our understanding of the virus' origins, Congress should be focused on developing commonsense solutions to put people over politics and protect our Nation from the threat of a future public health crisis.\n\nThere is still time for this select subcommittee to change course, to reject extreme partisan rhetoric, discard conspiratorial accusations and work constructively to save lives. The American people deserve nothing less.\n\nI yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.977510Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T15:57:59.494917Z","inner_id":2,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1802,"annotations":[{"id":282,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"cgQmfVH8Mt","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"4qPjp6ntcH","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T15:58:43.665951Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T15:58:43.665981Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":43.715,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"145223bf-6046-49ce-a017-71d56931cdf9","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1802,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":3,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup I thank the Ranking Member.\n\nI would like to remind the Ranking Member, and all those here, that the Ranking Member was informed of our witnesses seven days ago yet objected this morning.

We are primarily here because the Chinese government has done everything in its power to prevent the type of investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic that is three years overdue and still urgently required. We are also here because there is more that we in the United States can and must do to push forward, even if China continues to stonewall. This includes establishing a bipartisan U.S. national COVID-19 commission.\n\nI have waited more than three years for these hearings to be held. Getting to this point has required a great deal of effort by a small but tireless, self-motivated, and highly capable community of experts from around the world who have refused to be bullied into silence. Because so many of us have worked so hard for so many years against such ferociously strong headwinds to help lay the groundwork for these hearings, I join you today with a deep and sincere request that your committee honor our work by making these hearings as evidence- based, probing, and solutions-oriented as possible.\n\nUnderstanding what went wrong and determining how we can do better must be the ultimate bipartisan and nonpartisan issue. I happen to be a Democrat, which is irrelevant to our work together. Since the start of the pandemic, I have been in close contact with officials in the Trump and then the Biden administrations and have worked with Members of Congress of both parties on the pandemic origins issue. Although my views are laid out more fully in my written testimony, I'd like to quickly highlight my key points.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, approximately 20 million people, including over 1 million Americans, have died as a result of COVID-19. These are our parents, partners, children, relatives, colleagues, and friends. We owe every one of these victims and ourselves the fullest possible investigation into how this avoidable tragedy unfolded and our best efforts ensuring that a catastrophe like this never happens again.\n\nSecond, while the question of pandemic origins remains open, there can be no doubt that a research-related origin remains a very serious possibility, if not a distinct probability. There is no smoking gun proving a laboratory origin hypothesis, but the growing body of circumstantial evidence suggests a gun that is at very least warm to the touch. Those feeling otherwise also deserve to have their perspectives and research carefully considered. We should all be open to evolving our views as new evidence emerges. Everyone working in good faith to follow the evidence wherever it leads is on the same side. Those working to prevent this type of investigation are not.\n\nThird, it is inconceivable that over three years after this deadly pandemic began, no comprehensive and unfettered investigation into pandemic origins has been carried out, nor is one currently planned. This injustice is an insult to every victim of this crisis, and a clear threat to future generations. The primary reason there has been no comprehensive investigation into COVID-19 origins is the reprehensible actions of the Chinese government.\n\nSince the early days of the pandemic, China's government has destroyed samples, hidden records, imprisoned brave Chinese journalists, gagged Chinese scientists, actively spread misinformation, and done pretty much everything possible to prevent the kind of unfettered, evidence-based investigation that is so urgently required. Every person on Earth must demand accountability from China. Calling for a full investigation of pandemic origins in China does not at all mean we shouldn't carefully examine our own behavior and that of our friends and allies. In fact, we must.\n\nFourth, although scientific collaboration, including with Chinese scientists remains critical to building a safer future, we cannot purchase these relationships by our silence. We must at least match the courage of brave Chinese citizens, like Zhang Zhan who is rotting away in a Chinese prison for asking the same questions many foreigners seem somehow afraid to ask. There is no possible way to establish the principle of transparency and accountability tomorrow without fearlessly and unequivocally establishing that principle today.\n\nFifth, even if China continues to stonewall, there are critical steps we can and must take in the United States and elsewhere to move this process forward. This includes establishing a bipartisan U.S. national COVID-19 commission to examine the origins issue, as well as other failings and shortcomings on the national and international levels and develop bold recommendations for next steps.\n\nSixth, because the pandemic has taught us, at least I hope, that in our increasingly interconnected world, we are all only as safe as the most vulnerable among us, making us more secure here in America requires we do everything possible to help build a safer world, including by helping upgrade the World Health Organization. Although some people have criticized the WHO for how it has dealt with the origins issue, it is my view as outlined in my written testimony that WHO Chief Doctor Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been, in many ways, an unsung hero of this process.\n\nChairman Wenstrup, Ranking Member Ruiz, and members of the subcommittee, our world is entering a new era of globalization, where risks are increasing across the board, including the risk of pandemics far deadlier than COVID-19. If we do not get to the bottom of what went wrong with the COVID-19 pandemic, if we fail in our efforts to fearlessly understand all shortcomings and shore up the vulnerabilities this crisis has so clearly exposed, the victims of the next pandemic, our children and grandchildren, will ask us why we failed to protect them when we knew what was at stake and had the chance.\n\nThank you."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.978090Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:07:08.464844Z","inner_id":9,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1809,"annotations":[{"id":289,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"EndycDk4ZL","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"T_HjgHKukA","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:07:11.857202Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:07:11.857232Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.004,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"de96a6bb-2ce3-46f8-87ac-6387fcd89822","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1809,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":10,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Thank you.

This was a determinately non- racist book. It has no scientific errors that I am aware of. It has no racist statements, and it stresses the theme of unity that we are all variations on the same human genome. My book was vigorously attacked by obscure academics who want everyone else to believe that there is no biological basis to race. And my book was as welcomed to them as pictures of the earth from space are to flat-earthers.\n\nI have nothing to be ashamed of in my book. It's the only place you can now read about what the genome says about human races, and I hope Mr. Ruiz, if he reads it, will be pleasantly surprised to find it says none of the things he says it said.\n\nWith apologies for that digression, Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you for inviting me to discuss the origin of the COVID virus and hope you will allow me a few extra minutes. I am a science writer, and I worked on two leading research journals, Nature and Science, and then for 30 years on The New York Times, where I was an editorial writer and a science editor. This background has given me some knowledge of how the scientific community works.\n\nI'd like to touch on two issues of interest to the committee: Where did the SARS-2 virus come from, and why are we taking the lab-leak idea seriously only now, instead of three years ago? When the epidemic first broke out in December 2019, natural origin and lab leak were two equally reasonable explanations. But if the virus had emerged naturally, it should have left many telltale signs in the environment. None has yet appeared, despite the Chinese government's keen interest in finding them.\n\nAs each month passes without such evidence, the natural origins idea has grown steadily weaker, it seems to me. For lab leak on the other hand, the evidence has been building. Here are two of the three strongest pieces of evidence in favor of lab leak. First, the epidemic broke out not in some random Chinese city, but right in Wuhan, home of the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We know that scientists there were genetically engineering coronaviruses under seriously inadequate safety conditions, and we know that viruses escape from labs all the time. Clearly, lab leak has to be a strong possibility.\n\nSecond, that possibility became much more concrete with the recent surfacing of a grand proposal by the Wuhan researchers and others. They applied, in 2018, for a $14 million grant from a Pentagon program called Project DEFUSE. The essential ingredient of SARS-2, as the Chairman has said, one which makes the virus so infected is a small genetic element called a furin cleavage site. Wuhan researchers said in their grant proposal that they would insert this very element into a group of coronaviruses. And not only that, they will place the element at a very specific point on the virus' genome called the S1\/S2 junction.\n\nNow, the DOD turned the proposal down. It was too risky even for them, but the researchers may have done much of the basic work already or could have find other ways to finance it. A year later, the SARS-2 virus appears on the scene, and guess what? It possesses a furin cleavage site, the only known member of its large family of viruses to do so. And the cleavage site is positioned right at the S1\/S2 junction. Why should evolution produce, at that very time and at that very place, a virus of the exact type described in the DEFUSE proposal? It's surely much easier to believe that the Wuhan researchers did exactly what they proposed and generated the SARS-2 virus in their lab.\n\nBut if the evidence for lab leak is so strong, why do so many people still believe the virus came from nature? The reason is that the natural origin camp got its story out first, always a big help. It very successfully painted lab leak as a conspiracy theory before anyone in the public proposed it. The national media swallowed the natural origin story unskeptically and once committed to it, failed to report important contrary evidence such as the DEFUSE Grant. Science journalists in particular, it seems to me, fell down on their job by failing to check out the virologists' self-serving claims.\n\nThe natural origin theory did not prevail by accident. It was promoted by science administrators in the United States and England, including Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. The NIH is a national treasure and Collins and Fauci's most prominent leaders at the time are well-known to the public and on Capitol Hill. It's hard to believe that in the twilight of their long careers, they would seriously mishandle an issue as important as the origin of the COVID virus. Yet, that is what the evidence seems point to.\n\nThe campaign to discredit lab leak began on the evening of January 31, 2020, when Fauci received an email from four virologists led by Kristian Andersen of Scripps Research; they had all concluded that SARS-2, because of its furin cleavage site, could not been made in nature. Fauci was probably not too pleased to hear that the virus might have escaped from research that his agency had funded.\n\nA strange thing happened to the virologists' conclusion. Within four days, Andersen, in an email of February 4, repudiated, deriding lab leak as a crackpot theory. What made him change his mind? No new scientific evidence about the virus came to light between January 31 and February 4, but from that 180-degree reversal, a whole campaign was able to be developed, including highly influential articles placed in Nature Medicine and the Lancet.\n\nI have some ideas about how this and other research should regulated, which I described in my written testimony. I'll stop there."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.978274Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:10:31.966110Z","inner_id":11,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1811,"annotations":[{"id":291,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"3Z-E_toAa0","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"KsynBPxRt3","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:10:35.845271Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:10:35.845304Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.521,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"deffd7b6-3aa8-4eb7-b554-b43c3765d037","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1811,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":12,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Thank you.\n\nI now recognize Dr. Auwaerter to give an opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.978350Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:10:35.893565Z","inner_id":12,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1812,"annotations":[{"id":292,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"dFBBGxgZiT","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"s81w189VKq","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:12:37.560579Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:12:37.560610Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T16:12:23.516323Z","lead_time":121.298,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"52e9c7d3-887f-4f3e-8731-8659e3659ad1","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1812,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":13,"text":"Dr. Auwaerter Chairman Wenstrup, Ranking Member Ruiz, and distinguished members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify. Though I'm from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, I speak on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and my statements do not represent Johns Hopkins.\n\nOver 1 million Americans have died from COVID losses that magnify the tremendous suffering among countless families in our country. As a physician caring for patients with COVID for over three years, we need to deepen our understanding of the virus' origins and apply experience from the pandemic to improve our preparedness, prevent disease, and save lives.\n\nInvestigations must be objective and driven by appropriate, scientific, and intelligence experts who present unbiased findings. Investigations are ongoing. There's no consensus yet about the virus' origins. The Department of Energy, with low confidence, determined the virus escaped from a laboratory in China based on classified information unavailable to the public. The FBI reached its conclusion with moderate confidence.\n\nOn the other hand, many virologists believe compelling evidence points to an animal origin. They conclude that coronavirus most likely jumped from a caged wild animal into people at a seafood market. We may never know the origin conclusively. Making claims that cannot be supported sufficiently by available data only fuels confusion and mistrust. Regardless, we can learn valuable lessons from these investigations to prevent outbreaks and pandemics of any origin.\n\nA robust public health infrastructure and global coordination are essential for surveillance to identify, track, and contain potential threats. Pathogens respect no borders. We must collaborate internationally to foster an unsuspicious atmosphere where global information, sharing about infectious diseases is transparent, complete, and rapid.\n\nTwenty years ago, the SARS outbreak provides an instructive example of what can be achieved through multi-countries, scientific, and public health collaboration. Within six months, these collective efforts were successful in staunching the virus, and it has not reappeared. Greater transparency about science, decisionmaking, and public health will help improve health literacy and rebuild trust in science and public health, including understanding why recommendations evolve as knowledge grows.\n\nIf people are better prepared to understand science, they will be more comfortable deciding how to protect themselves and their loved ones best. The U.S. should invest in an expert work force to leverage preparedness tools to benefit all communities, meaning recruiting and training. Significant shortages of public health professionals, laboratory scientists, researchers, and infectious disease physicians persist. Federal investments are urgently needed to fill these gaps. Basic translational and clinical research are crucial for our pandemic preparedness.\n\nFor example, rapidly deploying tests for a new pathogen will enable quicker scaling of testing capacity when new threats emerge. Investments should also focus on developing therapeutics for anticipated pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, including multidrug resistant ones. Sufficient infectious diseases research capacity improvements to biosafety are essential. Access to BSL-4 facilities assists in bio- security research. Therefore, a new BSL-4 lab should be strategically placed throughout our Nation.\n\nThe Federal Government should support biosafety studies, including why laboratory accidents happen, their frequency, and other data needed to create and update evidence-based mitigation measures. Enhanced potential pandemic pathogens, ePPP research, a type of gain-of-function research has received renewed attention. Such efforts can help understand possible human pathogen interactions, assess the likelihood of emerging pandemics, and inform preparedness efforts, including surveillance and medical countermeasure developments.\n\nWhile such research is inherently risky requiring strict oversight, there are risks if we don't undertake this type of research, leaving us unprepared. Unbiased bodies with appropriate scientific expertise should perform this oversight. Last year, the U.S. Government charged the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) with reviewing policies regarding ePPP research and dual-use research of concern (DURC). In January, the NSABB released recommendations to strengthen the oversight of ePPP and DURC research in the U.S. and abroad, remove blanket exclusions, expand research types considered ePPP, strengthen guidelines, and increase transparency in the research review process.\n\nThese guidances can facilitate achievements with improved, appropriate guardrails. I am grateful for your attention and for inviting me. The Infectious Diseases of Society also thanks you for your leadership and stands ready to partner with you to learn from the pandemic and to improve our readiness."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.978445Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:12:37.607166Z","inner_id":13,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1813,"annotations":[{"id":293,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"zJRN5b2tuu","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"nvIJwcUX7c","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:12:40.590425Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:12:40.590455Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":2.619,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"e1044ece-037f-4405-89c4-e357c669e9fc","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1813,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":14,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Thank you.\n\nI now recognize Dr. Redfield to give an opening statement."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.978520Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:12:40.640082Z","inner_id":14,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1814,"annotations":[{"id":294,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"G3oivMbiho","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"XqBcPIC-ul","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:15:15.028105Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:15:15.028139Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T16:14:06.169366Z","lead_time":153.884,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"713cb098-aa5c-42ce-9e57-7a80feb57c24","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1814,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":15,"text":"Dr. Redfield Chairman Wenstrup, Ranking Member Ruiz, and members of the committee, I'm pleased to testify today in support of this subcommittee's important work to investigate the origin of COVID-19 that has resulted in the deaths of over 1 million Americans. From 2018 to 2021, I served as the 18th Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the Trump Administration. As CDC Director, I oversaw the Agency's response to the COVID-19 pandemic from the earliest days of its spread, and I also served as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force.\n\nBut perhaps more relevant for the purpose of this hearing, my 45 years in medicine have been focused on the study of viruses. I'm a virologist by training and by practice. Prior to my time at CDC, I spent more than 20 years as a U.S. Army physician and medical researcher at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research where I served as the Chief of the Department of Retroviral Research, and I worked in virology, immunology, clinical research, at the forefront of AIDS epidemic, and other threats.\n\nIn 1996, I cofounded the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland in partnership with the state of Maryland, the city of Baltimore, and the University System of Maryland, where I served as the director of clinical research and care. And I also served as a tenured professor of medicine, microbiology, and immunology, chief of infectious disease and vice chair of medicine at the University. After my time at CDC, I served as the senior public health advisor to Governor Hogan in the state of Maryland.\n\nAs COVID-19 began to spread across the world, there were two competing hypotheses about the origin of this virus that needed to be vigorously explored. The first hypothesis is the possibility that COVID-19 infections in humans were the result of a spillover event from nature. This is a situation in which the virus naturally mutates and becomes more transmissible from one species to another, in this case from bats to humans via an intermediate species. This is what happened in previous outbreaks of SARS and MERS and earlier coronaviruses that emerged from bats and spread through an intermediate animal.\n\nThe second hypothesis is the possibility that the virus evolved in a laboratory involved in gain-of-function research. This is a type of research in which scientists seek to increase the transmissability or pathogenicity of an organism in order to better understand that organism and inform preparedness efforts and the development of countermeasures such as therapeutics and vaccines.\n\nUnder this theory, COVID infected the general population after it was accidentally leaked from a lab in China. From the earliest days of the pandemic, my view of both theories about the origin needed to be aggressively and thoroughly examined. Based on my initial analysis of the data, I came to believe, and I still believe today, that it indicates that COVID-19 more likely was the result of an accidental lab leak than a result of the natural spillover event.\n\nThis conclusion is based primarily on the biology of the virus itself, including the rapid high infectivity for human- to-human transmission, which would then predict the rapid evolution of new variants as well as a number other important factors, which also include the unusual actions in and around Wuhan in the fall of 2019, all of which I'm happy to discuss today.\n\nEven given the information that surfaced in the three years since the COVID-19 pandemic began, some have contended that there's really no point in investigating the origin of this virus. I strongly disagree. There is a global need to know what we are dealing with in COVID virus because its effects how we approach the problem to try to prevent the next pandemic. The understanding of the origin of COVID is critical to future science research, particularly as it affects ongoing ethical debate around gain-of-function research.\n\nGain-of-function research has long been controversial within the scientific community, and in my own opinion, COVID- 19 pandemic presents a case study on the potential dangers of such research. While many believe that gain-of-function research is critical to get ahead of viruses by developing vaccines, in this case, I believe it was the exact opposite; unleashing a new virus to the world without any means of stopping it and resulted in the deaths of millions of people.\n\nBecause of this, it's my opinion that we should call for a moratorium on gain-of-function research until we have a broader debate, and we come to a consensus as a community about the value of gain-of-function research. This debate should not be limited to the scientific community. If the decision is to continue with gain-of-function research, then it must be determined how and where to conduct that research in a safe and responsible and effective way.\n\nI thank you for inviting me here today as we explore this important topic. I look forward to answering your questions. Thank you."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.978610Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:15:15.080047Z","inner_id":15,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1815,"annotations":[{"id":295,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"R_nND7b0t0","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"_wO9cnA4xI","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:15:38.481916Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:15:38.481950Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":22.963,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"6552708d-e5fa-4421-be10-e54012716ec9","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1815,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":16,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Thank you.

It wasn't very popular. These people were my friends. I knew them. Our inspections showed that they were cutting corners in their biosecurity requirements and I felt that we weren't going to take that chance with the Frederick community and beyond. So, I shut the lab down for four to six months until they corrected their biosecurity.\n\nI think this is much more complicated than people think and if we are to go down that path, I would argue there are a few labs in the world that should be, with multiple redundancy, in containment to do this.

And that President's policy failures, magical thinking, and total recklessness caused, according to his own special advisor on COVID, Deborah Birx, the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans.\n\nNow, apart from the urgent question of how to improve our pandemic response from the debacle that he presided over is the question how the COVID-19 pandemic began. This, too, is a critically important question to answer to help us prevent and prepare for future pandemics. Answers must come from objective, fact-based investigations, informed by doctors, scientists, and public health experts. At President Biden's direction, the intelligence community is also taking sweeping action now to understand the origins of the virus and to bring all relevant facts to light.\n\nWhatever the origins of COVID-19, whether it is bats or bureaucrats, no finding will ever exonerate or rehabilitate Donald Trump for his lethal recklessness in mismanaging the crisis in America which cost us more than a million lives. Indeed, if COVID was actually the product of a lab leak or the worst bioweapon of mass destruction ever invented as some have argued--and obviously we don't have the scientific evidence to say any of this yet--it would not only not remove Donald Trump's culpability, it would only deepen his culpability in the most profound way.\n\nNow, why do I say that? Because over the course of the crisis beginning in January 2020 and lasting through the spring on more than 42 different occasions that we have identified so far, President Trump openly praised and defended the performance of Communist Party Secretary and Chinese President Xi in his handling of COVID-19 and boasted of how closely they were working together and boasted of Xi's openness and transparency.\n\nOn January 22, 2020, when the first case of COVID was identified in the U.S., Trump stated, I quote, ``We have it totally under control.'' When asked if he believe the U.S. would, ``know everything we need to know from China,'' he said, and I quote, ``I do. I do. I have a great relationship with President Xi.'' January 24, he posted on Twitter, ``China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American people, I want to thank President Xi.'' March 21, in a briefing, he assured us, ``China has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus.'' He added, ``The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well.''\n\nMarch 27, he posted on Twitter, ``just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China, discussed in great detail the coronavirus that is ravaging large parts of the planet. China has been through much and has developed a strong understanding of the virus. We are working closely together, much respect.''\n\nBecause of time, I'm just giving the committee a tiny taste of Donald Trump's fawning, star-struck, sycophantic embrace of everything the Chinese government was telling him in 2020, but I will happily offer a lot more for any colleagues who think that the hunt for the origins will somehow absolve the last administration for telling Americans that COVID would magically disappear at Easter time, or everybody should just take hydroxychloroquine, or refusing to wear a mask, or never developing a national plan to defeat the disease.\n\nWhether it was bats or leaks or bureaucrats who caused it, Donald Trump was the biggest apologist in the United States of America for President Xi and the Chinese Communist Party. He could have directed the intelligence community to lead a COVID- 19 origin investigation back in March 2020. Three years ago. He did not. He wasted precious time minimizing the risk of the virus and lavishing his praise on President Xi. He could have taken the origins of the pandemic seriously and held the CCP accountable. He could have pushed back against the CCP for interfering with the WHO's investigation into its origins, and he could have asked our intelligence community to intervene. He did none of those things, and everyone should remember that. Let's take the politics out of it, and let's get to the bottom of what happened.\n\nThank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.991909Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:40:02.989794Z","inner_id":87,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1887,"annotations":[{"id":367,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"egpIje7aZk","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Wjo5j5U04-","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:40:59.313669Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:40:59.313700Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":55.95,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"b5900e75-66a6-44cf-8de2-048b809e714c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1887,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":88,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup I now recognize Ms. Malliotakis from New York for five minutes of questions."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.991983Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:40:59.360620Z","inner_id":88,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1888,"annotations":[{"id":368,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Positive"]},"id":"A6UymSV0s3","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Negative"]},"id":"W2spKDCM3L","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:42:40.524252Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:42:40.524280Z","draft_created_at":"2025-06-17T16:41:24.120422Z","lead_time":100.691,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"aa3ee695-e80b-4dfb-96bd-694036d7016f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1888,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":89,"text":"Ms. Malliotakis Thank you, Chairman.\n\nFor two years, myself and the other Republicans on this subcommittee connected the dots, we exposed the evidence supporting our strong belief that COVID was developed and leaked from the Wuhan lab.

Our investigations show this paper was prompted by Dr. Fauci among others with a goal to disprove the lab leak theory.\n\nWhat is the likelihood that these scientists came across additional information just three days after making these statements to conclude with such certainty that COVID-19 came from nature instead of the lab leak that they thought it was three days earlier?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:26.992361Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:44:50.663157Z","inner_id":93,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1893,"annotations":[{"id":373,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"UR3JdlBHDS","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"wqjtE7W00s","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T16:45:04.503058Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T16:45:04.503096Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":13.505,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"e169eff0-c965-4717-8247-b93b1755a6d7","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1893,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":94,"text":"Dr. Redfield.

They were trying to keep people safe and prevent deaths. I want everyone to know, I take this committee very seriously. I want the facts.\n\nDr. Redfield will confirm to you, I was one of the first people to call him about Wuhan, and had a lot of questions and never let up. So, I want the facts. But I hope and say to my colleagues on the other side, we cannot go down a dangerous path by pushing unfounded conspiracies about Dr. Fauci and other long-serving career public health officials. Here is the reality, like many of you, I am reading many articles, not just over the past weeks.\n\nDr. Redfield knows I've been on this from the beginning, talked to researchers, doctors, frontline nurses, public health officials. They all agree on one fact. After the billions of dollars on pandemic era upgrades to labs and data and surveyance, after all the studies and white papers about emergency preparedness, the U.S. still lacks two things in the public health arsenal: people and trust.\n\nThese continued smears on public health officials are destroying them. I strongly urge everyone on this committee, but my Republican colleagues specifically, from rehashing unfounded theories that Dr. Fauci and other public health experts have blocked investigations into the pandemic origins. Let's get the facts. Dr. Fauci has said we need to get to the bottom of how the novel coronavirus originated, and has said, and I've heard him say, like I talked to Dr. Redfield, he has an open mind about the virus' origins.\n\nTo all of you and all of us in this room, I say it's critical to rebuild trust and that continued attacks on public health officials only serves to further discredit people's confidence in our public health institutions, makes it almost impossible and it's challenging to recruit workers in the field, and it undermines people's trust in science.\n\nWe're seeing it. We know the basic things like washing your hands, covering your mouth when you cough, and immunizations save lives. And yes, because of all what we're doing, people aren't getting measles vaccines.

You're not a physician. You are not a physician's assistant. You are not a scientist. You have never done a peer-reviewed paper.

I just don't like that at all.\n\nIn your book, ``The Troublesome Inheritance,'' you talk about a number of different things--and David Duke talks about it--and says that he really endorses your position on Blacks and Jews. The book was championed by the infamous white supremacists, Jared Taylor, John Demarchar, and Steve Sailer. The book has been promoted on a neo-Nazi forum that is linked to almost 100 racially motivated attempted murders over the last five years. It troubles me that--and I'm going to ask unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman, that The New York Times piece for which you wrote actually said that your theory has come off at the wheels, particularly, when you talk about east Asians and their genetic makeup.\n\nI would like to ask that the David Duke statement and the copy from his website be entered into the record.

And thank you to all of our witnesses who are here today. I'm both a doctor and former director of the Iowa Department of Public Health as well as a military veteran of 24 years. Like Dr. Metzl said, I have waited three years for this hearing. And I have, in fact, put people over politics and science over conspiracy. Our first inquiry on the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis--this is my third year on this committee-- was June 29, 2021, on origins of COVID-19, and the only people that attended were Republicans.\n\nWe had a press conference at that hearing, and I was concerned that the public and the press weren't conveying that it wasn't partisan in trying to determine origins. It was, in fact, of utmost importance, and importance not just to Americans, but to the international community. At that press conference on June 29, 2021, I said: The reason we with need to know the origins of COVID-19 is to prevent and prepare for the next pandemic. We need to know, one, there are immediate disclosure rules. There was not immediate disclosure of a virus that would lead to a worldwide pandemic. Immediate disclosure and WHO has a vested interest in this in making sure there's compliance.\n\nLaboratory safety: it was known, even in the U.S., there are labs who have lab leaks, laboratory safety, biosafety lab for working being done in a biosafety lab too. It was known that this was occurring at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. So, lab safety. And, third, and I think Dr. Redfield has mentioned this--all of you have mentioned this--and that is, the ethics of gain-of-function research, or types of research. Often, we as scientists get ahead of the ethics. But the ethics of types of research, and again, the international community has a vested interest in discussing and debating these topics. I have published in journals before, peer-reviewed journals. I know how the editing and the peer-review process works. I also know very intimately of the disclosure requirements and conflicts of interest, including financial.\n\nOver the weekend, we released new emails and documents that suggested that Dr. Fauci prompted the drafting of a publication, ultimately, called ``Proximal Origins,'' that would disprove the lab leak theory. The authors of this paper skewed available evidence to achieve that goal. And Dr. Jeremy Farrar, now chief scientist for the World Health Organization, went uncredited despite significant involvement.\n\nAre you all aware of these documents? And just nod affirmatively. All of the witnesses except one have nodded yes. You know, many of you have been in journalism and in science writing for a long time. Dr. Metzl, can you explain the process briefly, because I have little time, of drafting, editing, and reviewing a publication in a science magazine."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:27.000870Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T17:16:05.240007Z","inner_id":148,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1948,"annotations":[{"id":428,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"jQopoYuTZ9","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"joaQuQLRjB","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T17:16:22.849753Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T17:16:22.849783Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":17.233,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"69ab8223-e2bf-40c7-8da9-930e25fe521b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1948,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":149,"text":"Mr. Metzl Well, Mr. Wade is probably better at this than me because he was an editor of two science magazines.

I tried to explain to Dr. Fauci, who's an immunologist, that this virus, SARS and MERS, when they infected man from the intermediate host, civic cat in the case of SARS and a camel in the case of MERS, they never learned how to go human to human. So, those original outbreaks are less than 1,000 people, and the epidemics died. When everyone thought this was SARS-like, well, it's going to die too. But this virus was immediately the most infectious virus-- not the most, I think probably right behind measles--virus that we've seen infect man.\n\nSo, I immediately said, wait a second, this isn't natural. And then you go back and look at the literature and you find in 2014 this lab actually published a paper that they put the H2 receptor into humanized mice so it can infect human tissue.

You know, from day one of this pandemic, unfortunately, politics has kind of infused a lot of this. And I know this--you know, obviously, Dr. Redfield, you and I had many conversations. In my time in Congress, you know, one of my focus areas has been global health security pandemic preparedness. I've sat on national task forces at CSIS to prepare for global health securities. We put out a recommendation, but, unfortunately, in the fall of 2019, and had pushed to put that framework in place.\n\nMy colleagues, Congresswoman Dingell and Congressman Ross have equivocally said, as Democrats, we want to find out what the origins of COVID were.\n\nEarly on in the pandemic, in January 2020, I pushed, personally, as hard as I could on the Trump Administration to do everything they could to get our scientists to the hot zone, to ground zero, to actually get a sense of what was going on. I am not going to defend how the Chinese Communist Party has handled this pandemic. They've stonewalled us. They've played politics. They've--you know, Dr. Metzl, you talked about the importance of WHO. They played politics with the WHO recommendations. And until we actually can get to the hot zone, until we--you know, I don't know that we'll ever get the data.\n\nThis is not a partisan issue. In fact, on the Intelligence Committee, which the Chairman is on, we marked up a COVID-19 Origins Act in a nonpartisan way. It passed out of markup with a voice vote. We will all get a chance to vote on that bill on Friday. I think you will see a strong bipartisan vote encouraging the intelligence community to declassify as much information as possible so the public can see the information that we have. It's not conclusive, but we've got to continue to try to find the COVID origins.\n\nI think it is reprehensible that we're disparaging some of our greatest public health individuals. Dr. Fauci, who I have known for a long time, and Francis Collins, who I've gotten to know, both are outstanding scientists, and so forth. They may have had a different hypothesis. We should entertain all hypothesis, and we should do it in an objective way to find the answers. I also hope we don't as a body take the wrong lessons from this.\n\nDr. Metzl, you talked the importance of the WHO. I would like your opinion on--international collaboration is extremely important, not just in pandemic preparedness, but also in biosecurity work, and so forth. We have to have the systems in place to identify pandemics fairly quickly, to think about how we address it, because, you know, whether this was man-made or naturally occurring, bad actors are out there who just saw what a virus did to the entire planet.

I couldn't find the justification for these strong arguments, calling people like me, investigating, looking into pandemic origins in good faith, conspiracy theorists. And it was very difficult. So, we had a small group that formed later in 2020 that is--others have called the Paris Group--all of the members of that community were aggressively trying to place scientific papers with journals and had zero success.\n\nSo, there was a wall that was extremely difficult to get over, which is why, what I said to this group is, look, we have to try to get around that wall.

And I read the news reports, and it said it comes from the market. And SARS-2 sounded kind of like SARS-1, and that seemed credible. But I had just been in Wuhan, China. So, I think a lot of Americans had this vision of Wuhan as some little market town where a bunch of yokels are eating bats for dinner every night. But Wuhan is China's Chicago. It's an incredibly sophisticated, highly educated, wealthy city. I knew that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was based there. I knew a lot about that background. I also had an understanding both of the science and of China. And then on January 24 of 2020, there was a Lancet paper written by Chinese scientists saying that more than a third of the earliest cases of infection were of people who had no connection to the market. So, in my mind, that was a pretty strong piece of evidence that the market was a super spreader place, which certainly is what I still believe. And that was when I started digging.\n\nAnd then in later February 2020, I had all of these ideas I was developing. I went to South Africa for the meeting of our World Health Organization expert advisory committee on human genome editing. And this is with some of the top scientists and others in the world. And then privately, I was telling people, like, here is my private view. Here is what I'm seeing in the evidence. And there was a part of me that was kind of hoping that they would say, Oh, no, you're crazy. Here is what you're missing. Because, you know, this is an uncomfortable hypothesis for many reasons. That wasn't--now, certainly, nobody was saying that. And that was why when I came back after those meetings, I became very, very public, and then I launched my website and wrote a number of editorials in March and early April."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:27.008715Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T17:59:48.432399Z","inner_id":194,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":1994,"annotations":[{"id":475,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"iKdu6YV5HZ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"fAL1wzTL40","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T17:59:53.300522Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T17:59:53.300551Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":4.505,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"2be697b4-49a1-417f-b48e-b4584f69593c","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":1994,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":195,"text":"Mr. Cloud I want to try to get another question in here.

I want to thank, of course, all of our witnesses as well for being here. We all care deeply about the work of this select subcommittee. I think it's critical. And we all can agree that we learn as much as about the COVID-19 origins as we can. We know that preventing future pandemics saves lives. That's what this is all about. That's what this committee is all about.\n\nWe have lost over 1 million American lives in this country, many more across the world. A lot of folks know I lost both my mother and my stepfather to the pandemic early on, so that I understand the human cost and tragedy of this virus.\n\nI'm very grateful that in May 2021, President Biden ordered the intelligence community to investigate the origins of COVID- 19. He specifically requested the Department of Energy be brought into as part of this important assessment. This has been discussed today. We know that this is critical work that's been happening. We also know that one way or another, we don't have clear proof about the origins of COVID-19. And this has been shared by our witnesses, and of course in the many reports that have been produced by our agencies.\n\nNow, we can make convincing cases, of course, for both potential lab leak, or if there was transmission from animals, but no one can say for certain where exactly the origins are today. And I think I want to repeat that so that it can be very clear to the American public as far as where we're actually at in this process and in these investigations. Multiple Federal agencies have supported both sides of the question and none with high confidence.\n\nOne of the most important lessons that we can learn from the origins of COVID-19 is how we can better respond to future viruses and future pandemics, because there will be future pandemics. We've seen the mass death, the devastation this has caused our economy and the American public and the global public. And we also need to know and understand what mistakes were made in the past so that we can correct them in the future.\n\nWe know, for example, that President Trump's own advisor on COVID-19, who we heard a lot from during the pandemic, Dr. Birx, had said that the previous administration's policies early in the pandemic possibly cost us hundreds of thousands of American lives.\n\nAnd I want to also note something that was said. We know that on more than 20 separate occasions, President Trump defended President Xi and his handling of COVID-19. We've been talking a lot about China and Chinese origins. But it's important to talk also about what the former President's comments were.\n\nSo, even as we had concerns about China's lack of transparency early on in the crisis, President Trump would consistently praise President Xi, in fact, on 20 separate occasions.\n\nI want to quote something former President Trump said, ``Last night, I spoke to President Xi. We talked about the experience that they had in China and of all the things that have taken place, and we learned a lot. They've had a very tough experience, and they're doing well, and he is doing well. President Xi is doing very well. But we learned a lot, and we have great communication together. We're going to be sent great data from China.''\n\nNow, it's very clear that that great data actually never came, and there was never really the cooperation that the President--that the former administration said that we were going to have. And over and over again, President Trump's Administration coddled the Chinese government and told us that this was all going to work out just fine, even though his doctors and scientists disagreed.\n\nIf members of this subcommittee are as concerned about role of the Chinese government in the origins of the pandemic, then we also need to take a serious look at why the former President repeatedly praised China and downplayed a virus that has gone on to kill over a million Americans. That is the work that the subcommittee should also be focused on.\n\nDr. Redfield, I know you mentioned in a New York Times interview that your greatest disappointment was lack of constant public health messages from civic leaders.

What would happen if there a moratorium on gain-of-function research, which includes developing medical capabilities, countermeasure and surveillance capacities."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:27.011634Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:11:44.251660Z","inner_id":229,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2029,"annotations":[{"id":516,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"HkB9anWVoK","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Q6XUCKLipQ","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:11:45.681444Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:11:45.681475Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":1.063,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"0b4044a2-afa8-448a-8f8e-d33165176342","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2029,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":230,"text":"Mr. Metzl Are you asking me?

That while Dr. Fauci, Dr. Andersen, Dr. Collins, Peter Daszak from EcoHealth, who, by the way, had a grant for gain-of-function research, Dr. Auchincloss and others were doing everything possible to shut down the Wuhan lab theory, publicly, even though privately they told each other that COVID-19 looked engineered and discussed the reason to stop the theory.\n\nAnd if they were to, it's really interesting, they wanted to give reasons for not expressing this opinion to the public were that it would do great potential harm to science and international harmony, and do unnecessary harm to science in general, and science in China, in particular, even though their paychecks are funded by the American taxpayers.\n\nAt the same time this was going on, the CCP was using its full weight and power to spread a propaganda campaign to conceal the origins of COVID, numbers of cases and deaths, and protect their own reputations while stockpiling medical supplies severely hurting the global supply chain and definitely hurting America.\n\nIn the same way the CCP's silenced, censored and prisoned dissenters who tried to tell the truth, Dr. Fauci and his cohorts seemingly were running their own misinformation and, ultimately, censorship campaign to, in quotes from Dr. Collins to Dr. Fauci, ``put down this very destructive conspiracy about the lab leak theory.''\n\nBut it's really interesting.

And one of the things I want to talk about that hasn't really been addressed here from this side of the aisle is that, yes, I do believe that public health has been devastated by this COVID-19 pandemic. But, that is because public health officials in this country decided that they were going to consider the politics surrounding this issue when making statements and recommendations. That's the root of the problem with the public health here.\n\nAnd, yes, this must be repaired. We have to get our public health industry back. The only way that that will change, the only way that that will change is if we--and that we can regain the trust and confidence that we have to have in this country in our public health sector is to look back at what happened, who made what decisions, and why those decisions were made. And, most importantly, if public health authorities, such as Anthony Fauci, betrayed the trust of the American people, they must be held accountable. Period. Somebody has to be held accountable. This is a problem we have in government, throughout government. If there's no accountability, nothing changes.\n\nWe're going to be doomed to repeat this whole disastrous period in American history again if we don't get the answers about what happened and why it happened.\n\nSo, in addition, I just want to say that this continues to this very day. The WHO, China, the mainstream media, social media, they all need to be called out. They need be to held accountable for their part in this coverup. Millions of people died, and we need some answers to what's going on.\n\nAnd I'll say that we still have an issue with this today. We still have an issue with corrupt, politically driven advice. And this is evidenced by the misinformation regarding masks, natural immunity, the need for boosters, and most importantly and most important to me at this particular time, the inappropriate efforts to vaccinate our children.\n\nSo, I would just say that we have to regain this trust in public health, and we have to do it quickly before something like this comes down the pike again, because the American people right now have zero trust and confidence in the public health sector in this country.\n\nSo, I want to ask you real quickly, Dr. Metzl and Dr. Redfield, what do you think that we should and could do to regain that trust of our public health sector?"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:27.017303Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:27:50.680792Z","inner_id":247,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2047,"annotations":[{"id":557,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"eQ_9yDsRJH","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"wIB1iwAwA5","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:28:06.918208Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:28:06.918239Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":15.895,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"1bb0f83b-2a37-4c60-893e-72692edcc066","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2047,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":248,"text":"Mr. Metzl A number of things.

So, when you're spending your time making sure that the country believes only one of these theories, you could have been doing what Dr. Redfield was doing in our government, trying to figure out how we deal with this virus.

And that's the part that ticks us off, because this is the highest paid guy in our government, getting all kinds of money to tell us things that were not accurate. Because we now know U.S. tax dollars went to a lab in China, a lab that was not up to code, a lab that was doing gain-of-function research, and that's where this thing most definitely came from. And Dr. Fauci had to prove no, no, he can't have that news getting out. And that's why he did what he did to the exclusion of a brilliant guy running our CDC; kept him out of the loop. Keeping him out of the loop, probably potentially could have harmed America.

And I believe that Dr. Ruiz, the ranking member on the subcommittee feels exactly the same way. You know, there's a difference between saying I disagree with you and here's why, as opposed to labeling something a conspiracy theory, or someone a conspiracy theorist. There's a huge difference. That's the politics that comes in. We need to get it out. No more. For this committee, and as a general discussion across America, I hope that that can change.\n\nI'm first a physician.

I've had a security clearance since 1998 as a soldier.\n\nThis subcommittee is about an after-action review, lessons learned through this process, finding truths, and building a path forward so that we can have readiness in the future. That's what we need to do.\n\nMy life has been about trying to improve other lives to keep people healthy and also about the security of the United States of America. I'd love for this thing to be from nature. I would love that. Because that would be better for all of us. But I can't help but look at this and say, there's another possibility here. And when I think of that other possibility, it leads my mind with my experience in life to so many nefarious things that can happen to us as a people. This is a national security issue. This is a national health issue.\n\nSome things might start out as good. I don't think the Wright brothers ever intended for planes to be flown into buildings to kill thousands of people. That may be the case. We need to consider all those possibilities, the lessons learned. I can give you some lessons learned. You know, we're talking about trust and building trust. And I will tell you, going back to Secretary Azar, I made the suggestion, America needs to hear from doctors that are treating COVID patients. I think that would be the most helpful. That's who they know. That's who they trust. Those are the people in the trenches, not from politicians, and not from someone who's never at bedside who's just in the lab.\n\nThe origins of this is important. Because when we talk to doctors who are treating patients, for example, though, this is where I think early on it was most important, because all they were concerned about, and all Americans were concerned about is whether they were going to live or die. And will you come up with a cure or a vaccine? That's all they worried about. But as we try to move forward, the origins of this is important, so that we don't have to struggle in the same way that we did through all of this. And trust is important.\n\nDr. Redfield, I agree with you on the declassification. Hopefully, we will get there. It's important for transparency, for sunlight on all of this. Obviously, there's methods and other things we have to keep out. I get that. And you'd commented on another thing that I had written down before you said it, because to me it's important as a doctor to be honest about what we don't know. And when we don't know something, and we hypothesize something, and then we find out we're wrong we have to say we didn't know, and now we know better. That didn't happen.\n\nAnd I'll give you an example. You know, early on, people were saying, well, in the summer, it may dissipate like other coronaviruses have in the summer. That made sense, but it didn't happen. And we should have said, oh my gosh, that didn't happen. This thing isn't called novel for a reason, and we need to do a little more digging.\n\nI am open to various opinions, especially from experts in the arena, including doctors that are treating affected patients. That's where we have to go. This committee is going to deal with all aspects of the pandemic, but this is one that's very important and on the minds of every American.\n\nI want to thank you all for your testimonies today, for taking the time to be with us. We may have to see you again, we'll see. But at the same time, I do want to thank all of you for being here. And with that, I will turn it over to the ranking member for his final comments. Thank you."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:27.019748Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:34:40.115718Z","inner_id":280,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2080,"annotations":[{"id":597,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"u3JYQO3LcE","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"zQQF48r2PO","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:35:53.430805Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:35:53.430836Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":72.862,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"629de7c2-2d39-41a9-b71a-bf853e15410f","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2080,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":281,"text":"Dr. Ruiz I, too, want to thank all the witnesses for coming today and testifying before this committee.\n\nLet me be clear, my Democratic colleagues and I take seriously the charge of determining the coronavirus' origins. And that is why we must allow scientists and intelligence experts to do their research without politicizations, or politicians politicizing the issue using extreme partisan rhetoric or making conclusions or accusations without concrete evidence. It seems like minds on the other side of the aisle are shut and made up on the origins, and they have chosen their villain.\n\nIf we truly want to follow the evidence, the truth is that the evidence as we have it now is inconclusive. But villainizing our public health experts through conspiratorial accusations based on partisan suspicions and not concrete evidence does nothing to help us prevent and prepare for future pandemics.\n\nI, too, am a physician. I, too, have taken care of patients who have died due to dyspnea; in other words, they couldn't breath; they didn't get the oxygen. And I have intubated and kept people alive and resuscitated people over and over in the emergency department. These are not political ideas for the individual who's diabetic and lives in a poor neighborhood that doesn't have access to testing or to healthcare access.\n\nThis is not political. They don't give two cents of who knew what and by when. They want to make sure that they stay alive, that they can get the medicines, that they can live in a country that doesn't have to politicize every single damn thing. And they want to see their government work for them, for the people, to do the right thing.\n\nAnd I do agree that we need to evaluate the evidence as it comes, just like when we had the lack of evidence of this novel virus, and we made, as Dr. Redfield and Dr. Auwaerter said, some conservative decisions in order to protect until we knew more, until we were able to have the resources to put shots in arms, students responsibly back into schools, people responsibly back into work.\n\nBut villainizing our public health experts undermines our efforts to do so. You see it hurts the recruitment of public health servants in a time when we have a public health servant shortage. And it hurts trust. It hurts trust in basic public health measures like masks that reduces airborne transmission and vaccines that save lives.\n\nCongress has an important role in supporting the expert community's efforts to get to the bottom of the coronavirus' origins. We also have an important role to be forward looking in developing the policy solutions necessary to mitigate the threat of new viruses, no matter where they came from.\n\nYou know, I saw each of the witnesses nod in agreement in my discussion with Dr. Auwaerter regarding constructive policy solutions like raising the international standards for pathogen research.\n\nThere is still an opportunity for us to correct course. And this is a message on both sides of the aisle for this select subcommittee to be a constructive body that focuses on forward looking solutions; ones that save lives that matter to individuals who are at risk of dying today from this virus.\n\nSo, let's debate gain-of-function research. Let's discuss what we can do to improve safety guidelines and transparency in foreign labs. Let's discuss how to increase trust in basic public health measures to save lives and recruit more public health workers. Let's put people above politics. We owe it to the American people to take every action we can to save lives. And I stand ready to work with the Chairman to do so."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-06-17T12:58:27.019833Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:35:53.478512Z","inner_id":281,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":2081,"annotations":[{"id":598,"completed_by":2,"result":[{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"8ZsXaHUISW","from_name":"stance-on-topic-1","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"choices":["Neutral"]},"id":"Y1VjpZSzAm","from_name":"stance-on-topic-2","to_name":"text","type":"choices","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-06-17T18:36:01.121362Z","updated_at":"2025-06-17T18:36:01.121394Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.306,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"a38eacd6-59e2-4f92-8599-a8ad42345b3b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"task":2081,"project":13,"updated_by":2,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"6df04157-hearing.json","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"id":282,"text":"Dr. Wenstrup Thank you, Dr. Ruiz.
